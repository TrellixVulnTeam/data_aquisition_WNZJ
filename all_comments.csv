			I‚Äôll use the same argument but from the other side. Humanity has been here for thousands of years; through plagues, blights, famine, ecological catastrophes...you name it and we‚Äôre still here. Most of those things happened well before there was a global economy to consider. So if we look at it from a black and white stand point us waiting a month to let things settle will have zero impact on humanities overall survivability. The only difference is when we talk about The Plague or any other threatening event it‚Äôs rather foreign and doesn‚Äôt involve us. The word quarantine came about during the plague. As a measure of safety it‚Äôs what they did. If we talk about the Great Depression we do in fact know mortality rate as a whole did not increase. People didn‚Äôt starve to death though times were tough. For years. Suicide rates did increase but there wasn‚Äôt some mass plummet in life. And that‚Äôs really all we can compare it too. The Great Recession also didn‚Äôt cause an increase in mortality. So when there is a comparison about ‚Äúwhat could possibly happen based off history‚Äù then it tells us no matter what we do humanity will go on. This just affects us and all these ‚Äúaltruist‚Äù notions of the economy and ‚Äúthink of the grandkids‚Äô future!‚Äù come off as putting money before life. I‚Äôm also fairly certain when anyone says ‚Äúmany will die‚Äù they aren‚Äôt counting themselves or their immediate family in that tally. And as I asked in another post, I‚Äôm also certain those championing an immediate return to normalcy at the risk of others wouldn‚Äôt forgo treatment as to not tax an already overburden healthcare system should they themselves wind up on the receiving end of the unlucky stick. I‚Äôd also wager if they lost a child or loved one ‚Äúyeah some people will have to die‚Äù won‚Äôt be the soothing and comforting words of choice at the wake. ‚ÄúJohnny was a great son. But many people had to die for the sake of our economy!‚Äù just doesn‚Äôt roll off the tongue smoothly. 
 


	So, as far as humanity is concerned, us waiting a month will literally be an insignificant blip when it‚Äôs all said and done. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

			Those people are literally telling people not to be out there. The people you are purporting to support are saying if you‚Äôd like to support them and their efforts to keep people alive then do the opposite of what you‚Äôre proposing. There‚Äôs a whole social media campaign by medical staff encouraging people to not be out if they can avoid it.  
	 
 


	And I‚Äôm trying to make it clear that I am strongly in favor of trying get the economy restarted and for people to be back at work. Even if for my own selfish reasons. I understand that need. I just want us to be smart about it.
 


	If you got sick would you seek medical help or languish at home and hope you recovered?

			In 1946 congress removed the excessive profit tax, cut corporate tax rates, and cut top income tax rates. Those measures surely can‚Äôt go unnoticed or overlooked.

			Please educate me then. Seriously, tell me how a war and a war funds would lead to an economic boom when a lot of the jobs during that time would‚Äôve been for the war effort. There was definitely a drop in unemployment but the economic boom came after the war ended. So we traded unemployment for debt, right? Literal fact: the national debt went from  49 billion at the start of the war to ~260billion at the end.

			Nothing like a good! I‚Äôm being sarcastic of course. The ending of the war is probably better attributed to the ending of the Great Depression. Government spending during didn‚Äôt really contribute or doesn‚Äôt equal consumer spending. And the government‚Äôs spending during that time was simply added to the GDP. Increased taxes and borrowing from the government to fund a war effort doesn‚Äôt necessarily stimulate the economy.

			I understand things have to restart. I do. It‚Äôs not feasible to go 18 months or even another 6 months for that matter. I definitely understand that. I was just saying if I‚Äôm expected to go back out there for the sake of the economy at the behest of those opting to stay home and safe then they too should just come on out and join the fun. ‚ÄúMany will die‚Äù feels a lot different when It‚Äôs a possibility you and your loved ones might be part of those figures.  
	 
 


	Since the Great Depression is often the comparison it took about a decade if I remember correctly for things to turn around with the New Deal being a major catalyst. I‚Äôm the grandson of depression era grandparents. The idea that ‚Äúwe have to do this for future of our grandkids‚Äù feels a little anemic when we‚Äôre right back where they started (if that‚Äôs the economic comparison). And even more frustrating when people are eager to get back to normal when clearly what was normal doesn‚Äôt necessarily work when scrutinized or put to the test. Oh, and there‚Äôs 0 plan for those us going back out there to test the waters.

			Imma need some of you ‚Äúat risk‚Äù people so keen on sending everyone else out restart the economy to go ahead and join the parade. 
	 
 


	How about this; since we know there will be plenty of jobs and people maybe cautious in taking the most risky ones like grocery store workers, malls, service industry, and really anything else that would expose you to others at high frequency you guys take. You forgo your social security, Medicare or Medicaid (whichever you old people get), special shopping hours, and whatever other senior discounts and benefits currently receive. Employers only have to provide basic insurance if they have so many employees so there‚Äôs no guarantee there but you can always purchase your own on the free market. Or don‚Äôt since it‚Äôs not required. 
 


	If you have adult children you should also move in with them. As many have said we‚Äôre all likely going to get it (might as well expose them early and quickly!) and if they‚Äôre young and have young kids they‚Äôre likely not going to die. But even if they do die, as sad as that maybe, I‚Äôm reminded of the mantra ‚Äúsome people will in fact die.‚Äù Now if you should get sick and need hospitalization you will be required to figure out how you‚Äôre going to pay for that care. And how you will maintain your job during that absence.  If you should pass while performing an act for the greater good that is the economy and future of your children, grandchildren, and even great grandchildren then know they will receive a plaque with your name on it and a ridiculously large hospital bill. Someone has to pay that after all. But do not fret! Your sacrifice in restarting the economy will never be forgotten.

			I‚Äôm employed and made it through a round of layoffs going on at this very moment. I also have other means of income so my position And view is heavily skewed. I can say we should wait it out a little longer because I‚Äôm doing ok; however, it would be nice to get back to some semblance of normalcy because I know people are in fact struggling. I can say wait it out because I‚Äôm speaking from a place of privilege.  
	 
 


	The biggest problem I see in lifting the ban is there hasn‚Äôt been anything said or put in place if someone gets seriously sick. Companies aren‚Äôt being told to provide additional and adequate paid sick leave. ‚Äúif you‚Äôre sick stay home‚Äù literally isn‚Äôt an option for a lot of people.  Insurance companies aren‚Äôt giving passes should you wind up in the hospital or need any other specialized care. There‚Äôs zero for lost wages or automatic life insurance policies should the worst happen. Households can also be mixed with a combination of healthy and vulnerable people. What do we do for them?  Additionally the argument that since I‚Äôm young and healthy so maybe won‚Äôt suffer too bad doesn‚Äôt hold weight. I‚Äôm not trying to be the odd man out. Nor do I want me friends to be that person either.  
	 
 


	In short it‚Äôs a mess that‚Äôs going to require some forward thinking that changes the status quo.

			Nah - she's just someone I could quote - I always try to follow the proper academic principle of quoting reliable sources. Ms Winfrey seems to have earned her place as a revered public persona, and GOD is harder to quote.

			It's not an easy place for anybody to be in right now. There are plenty of us who are not providers that have already been laid off and have no means of income. Individuals with no savings and/or credit who are living paycheck to paycheck are going to feel this first and most certainly the hardest.
 


	What would be most devastating is if the unregulated derivatives markets fail. Then, the BIG BOYS in government would most certainly provide bailouts for the big corporations and investors who have been betting on futures.  Yes, every American will likely get a couple of checks for $1200 bucks, but the amount of money that would go into the pockets of already wealthy speculators will be obscene.

			Honestly, if I'm asked to download an app for GPS tracking of my movement, I'm fine with it, if it helps do contact tracing as the world starts to open back up.  It can be turned off, temporarily, as well.    
	This will be an important tool to help us trace and contact people who are exposed to known cases.  That's my take - the phone companies and 3rd parties already know tons about me, so it's not that big of deal to me.  Then again, I'm in healthcare, and I see the benefit.

			Good questions. But it's considered bad form to ask about specific places on the public boards. That could attract the attention of law enforcement, and make those establishments the target of a bust.
 


	That said, they look like AMPs (asian massage parlors). Not all AMPs offer happy endings or, uh, total relaxation. (Which is why you probably asked, I know.) The subject of AMPs comes up frequently in the forums. You can probably find some good general information.  For massage parlors, Rubmaps.ch is a fee-based web site that offers consumer reviews. You can also find out if a place or a specific masseuse offers more than a standard rub. One poster here suggested getting a one-month membership to Rubmaps, researching all the places you'd be interested in visiting, then cancelling your membership.
 


	From what I've read:
 


	In general, you'll show up at the door. Either the mama-san or a masseuse will answer and ask you how long you want. You'll be led to a small room with a table. If you are asked if you've been there before, answer yes. It's a screener question to see if you might be interested in a hand job or whatever. Strip totally. That will also signal that you're open to Other Services. Put a tip on the table or in an obvious place. I don't really know how much to tip. It should be at least the door fee. If you tip double the door, that'll make the masseuse really happy, but it might be overkill. The masseuse will either pretend to give you a massage or actually give you one as you're face down. 
 


	She might initiate some more intimate moves. Then she'll ask you to flip over. You can indicate with a gesture or a look what you'd like. She may ask you in a whisper. She may upsell.
 


	Your experiences can vary widely, even in the same parlor. 
 


	According to knowledgable sources, the women are generally going to be middle aged. Sometimes, they will be middle aged and kind of cute or, even more exceptionally, youngish and cute, but it's almost never that you'll see a 7 or above (to be crass). It can happen, though. Some Korean places in Denver years ago had some attractive workers. But whoever it is, it will never be the cutie in the ad. Also, they don't speak English very well. 
 


	Also, keep in mind that many fine women offer FBSM in the Boulder area as independent workers.

			Thanks NoCoGeezer for bringing back a lot of good memories. You are correct, there was a rub n tug place on Canyon, just up from the courthouse. That made me a little nervous when I was exiting the place. I'd bet a lot of attorneys and their clients got some high quality stress relief there.
 


	There was indeed a brothel on north Broadway; it's now a Subaru repair shop. Very pretty ladies worked there as well.
 


	There used to be a hotel up on Broadway with hot tubs in the back of the rooms. It was real fun to drop some MDMA, look at the stars and hang with my girlfriend at the time, a stripper from the Colorado Mining Company. Pre AIDS. Pre herpes. You youngins have no idea. 
 


	I've been missing the Bustop for a while now. Construction has been underway for another architectural shit box where it used to be. I remember many fine nights there. The women were friendly and chatty, not totally about the hustle, and the drinks didn't cost much, for a strip club. Kinda like Friends, only with tits and ass. As another poster mentioned, you could get pretty lucky there. A lot of smart, adventurous women worked that stage.
 


	Nitro is way more upscale, and the girls work ya pretty hard. The entertainers are all quite beautiful, though.  Some guy a while back posted about getting lucky with a dancer, so maybe I've been there on off-nights. Also, having the dancers at eye-level feels weird to me. But, not at all the same vibe. Still, the owners played a great game getting that place in town.
 


	The last time I went to the Bustop, a hot entertainer seemed clearly, and so sincerely into me. That is, until I told her I didn't actually want to be her sugardaddy if that only meant holding her bags at the Cherry Creek Mall while she went shopping with my credit card. 
 


	Age. It happens.

			You might find this useful:
 


	http://www.internationalsexguide.nl/forum/forum.php
 


	I can't verify how solid the information is, since I don't travel internationally very often now. Still, you can get a pretty reasonable overview of the lay of the land.
 


	I'd have to echo the advice about either not hobbying in China at all or taking time and building a relationships with some gatekeepers over a long period. The few people I know who have worked in China and who hobby usually did the fun stuff in Hong Kong or Bangkok or other big Asian cities -- not in China itself. The government has been cracking down on so-called vice activities overall. 
 


	Personally, I've had very mixed experiences internationally -- great and horrific -- and those were in Western countries with tolerant regimes. Even then, the ripoffs and danger is high -- part of the excitement, but also awful when things don't work out (I'm still pissed about a 400 euro self-service job, and no, don't ask because I'm not going to say any more about that). (And I'm not actually a total idiot, believe it or not). These were in places with very low linguistic barriers -- nothing like dealing with ideograms and Mandarin. As you'd guess in a huge country emerging from poverty, there are a lot of very sharp hustlers. If it were utterly corrupt, like some other countries, you'd probably be better off, but China's in the worst between zone -- corrupt, but also with puritanical government crackdowns.
 


	You probably know this, too, but all of your Internet activity will be tracked, as well as your phone calls. You should assume any electronic activity you engage in will be documented by the authorities.
 


	Also, China's government is an absolutely evil totalitarian regime. If you want some confirmation, google ""Uigur"" or consider what's happening in Tibet, let alone the violence in Hong Kong. The people can be great, but the system is one of the very worst on the planet.

			Very cool link, thank you for posting. The women really own themselves in most of the images.
 


	I recently read Charlie Chaplin's memoir, and a criminal's memoirs, You Just Can't Win. Both of them described whole city blocks given over dozens of brothels, dance halls and bars in any sizable town around the turn of the last century. Charlie Chaplin said Denver's was particularly good, and Kansas City boasted a huge red light district larger than many small towns. It made the chief of police a wealthy fellow, with all the bribes and payoffs.
 


	Also cool about brothels: jazz.
 


	I've had good experiences in brothels, generally. In Denver, the old 'hot tub' places functioned as brothels. That was fun. Then the Caucasian massage parlors in the early 80s were effectively cat houses. Many of the workers were very attractive, and you could easily find someone you vibed with out of a crew of eight or so. 
 


	Supposedly, this is the menu of a New Orleans brothel. It looks authentic, anyway. If it is, it proves great grandpa was as kinky, or kinkier, than you.

			Glory holes were a relatively common part of gay subculture, pre-AIDS.
 


	Back in olden times, I was interested in the seedy side of life. On a trip to San Francisco back in the early 80s -- pre-AIDS and pre-herpes scare -- I ended up in a porno palace not far from the Tenderloin. It was a kind of Dave and Busters for sex -- arcades, girls behind glass, a strip club, a porn shop. Next door to the pleasure palace was an unmarked door.
 


	Had to be good, right?
 


	Behind the door was a junky gate keeper who took money for the glory hole in the back of the shop. He had to explain the concept to me. He also swore there were females on the other side of the holes.
 


	I bailed, for a lot of reasons -- the vibe there was heavy and dark, literally and figuratively. The idea of sticking Mr. Happy through a gap into a random person's mouth creeped me out -- even when I was a complete moron as well as high and horny.  I had visions of a legless, toothless hag working on my knob, and split.
 


	(Now, that was that place and that time.  If consenting people of whatever gender and however they identify want to indulge, go for it. It's not my business.)
 


	Not long afterwards, the topic came up again --- I used to work in a profession that's popular with gay men. They talked about glory holes (along with bath houses and the rest of it.) Glory holes were a fairly common thing, I guess, and available in some of the more radical gay clubs both informally and officially. (So this is hearsay, because I don't have any direct experience of this).
 


	He'd also confirmed what Mr 2 Big has noted -- they're always dudes on the other side. No matter what the advertising.
 


	I also remember those arcade booths with the holes punched in the walls. And, man, that's one thing I don't miss about those pre-VHS, pre-DVD days. It seemed as if every time I wanted to drop a slug to watch Seka get it on in 8mm technicolor glory  there was some guy in the next booth begging to blow me. (Again, consulting adults, blah blah, but .... thank you, nah.)

			Well, you could savor the delicious irony of someone complaining about how he or she is smarter than everyone else while expressing that thought in atrocious grammar and syntax.
 


	So, you could spend your extra time learning English grammar. Or, you could take an extra minute or so to look over what you've typed and correct obvious errors.
 


	Now, personally speaking, I am not so smart. In fact, I'm rather stupid. What I have noticed about people smarter than I am is that they are curious. About ideas, books, countries, cultures, history, science, mathematics and -- a lot of the time -- they are curious about other people. Even idiots like me.
 


	I'd suggest you put that high-powered intellect of yours into trying to understand the people you encounter. What motivates them? Why? What influences shaped their view of life? What is their view of life? It'd be actually worthwhile to understand what a moron -- like me, for example -- thinks about the nature and purpose of things, so you could avoid the same snares.
 


	The other thing I've noticed about the people that are much smarter than I, is that they're rarely bored. So you could learn a foreign language, study physics, volunteer for a literacy program to teach people who can't even read or write a few necessary skills. You could avoid humanity altogether and learn Classical Greek and Latin, look for a cure for cancer ... the possibilities are really endless.
 


	(And, just so you know, I generally dislike people who use errors in grammar and syntax of person who posted in a forum, but, in your case, I made an exception. And if English is a second language, then, bravo for learning it up to a certain point. But maybe you should learn it a tad bit better.)
 


	Good luck to you, and I hope you can bear that painful burden well as you go through the rest of your life.

			You should print out jj254-1's advice and follow it to the t. It's one of the best pieces of counsel I've read on this board.
 


	Turn the page. Move on. Get your shit together. Figure out what you want to rescue from the burning house that is your marriage.
 


	She betrayed you. No amount of counseling and conversations will change that. If you can accept that, forgive her completely,  and trust her from now on, then, yeah, sure. Stay with her. Let the Vatican know, too, because you will be in line for sainthood.
 


	You could try marital counseling. In my experience, that usually amounts to the female therapist and the female spouse agreeing that the male in the relationship has issues that he needs to work on. It's also expensive, takes a lot of time and work, and generally only delays the inevitable break up. Again, that's based purely on my observation of the many couples I've known who've gone through it. It could be different for you.
 


	(On the other hand, one--on-one therapy with a good mental health professional can be totally worth it.)
 


	Forget about taking revenge. It's sweet, I know. But you want to get out clean, stay in your kids' lives, and move on. Plotting or taking revenge will destroy that, burn up your headspace, and eat you alive. And that's if everything goes well. Without knowing the details, you're almost certainly dealing with a complex situation that you can't game out accurately. People are unpredictable. And perhaps I've watched one too many true crime shows, but the situation can degrade quickly.
 


	Also, watch the booze. When you're grieving and angry, throwing alcohol in the mix will only make things worse. At best, it promotes melodrama and weight gain. At worst, you'll be acting like a bozo and you could even pick up a bad habit that will alienate your children.
 


	So, put your stuff in line. Act like a responsible, mature, and solid man. Get out as neatly and quickly as you can. That way, you be more likely to preserve your relationship with your children.
 


	And move on to a better chapter in your life.

			I've been pondering this myself over the weekend. [snip]
 


	Gifted with the wealth of those cretins, I would build or buy a Taj Mahal. It would be outfitted with rich silks, tapestries, amazing bathrooms, and, of course, bidets.  I'd have a different bedroom with a different courtesan for each day of the week, and then mix it up depending on my mood. I'd have theme rooms -- Egypt! Decadent Rome!! 1920s Weimar Berlin!! T'ang Dynasty China! Shogunate Japan!! And put the right woman in with the right costumes in each place. I'd have the most gifted musicians playing live music blindfolded, and a rotating harem of beauties across the rainbow. I'd make Louix XV look like a choirboy, is what I'd do. I'd order in a few pallets of oysters and champagne and when than runs out and I need some refreshment, I'd make like a pasha and have ostrich feathered fans waft perfume my way while I studied the outlines of all those perky breasts around me. I'd ask Laetitia and Cinnamon to peel me a few grapes, and then I'd study up on some more variations from the Kama Sutra and Anais Nin to try out. 
 


	Short of that, I'd buy a goddam penthouse suite, pay off the staff, and sweep in whatever lovely or set of lovelies I'd want and hire some clever dude to hide it behind several layers of ownership. And never, ever go into politics.
 


	This is just off the top of my head, you understand. I am basically, a simple fellow with sort of vanilla tastes. But these guys are rich, Rich, RICH. Get it? The set up I'm talking about, prolly worth a little, but you got a hobby, you should take it seriously.
 


	And when they busted my sorry ass, the whole world would at least marvel at just what a decadent motherfucker I was. They sure as shit wouldn't be mocking me in some lame-ass strip mall next to the goddam Godfather's Pizza outlet.
 


	(By the way, I figure if I can figure out how to lavish my generosity on a sweet sex worker in nearly any major city in the world, probably a canny billionaire could too.)

			Nope. I wouldn't worry about fapping to those who've passed on. 
 


	As other posters have mentioned, it might even be welcomed in the Great Beyond. Maybe it'll be a kind of posthumous tribute that will ease their passage in the bardo.
 


	What I'm wondering is: what about those porn stars who've aged badly. For example, Ginger Lynn. She was a babe. Then she recently made some MILF scenes that are horrific if you compare her MILF self to herself back in the day. When I saw how she looks now, and then fired up an old porno of her ... well, it just reminded me of decay, age and how time defaces everything.  So yeah, I lost interest and felt weird. Luckily, I surfed a bit more and found something good with Bree Olson in it and forgot about the trauma.

Don John|https://theotherboard.com/forum/index.php?app=core&module=members&controller=profile&id=1405|Denver|01/27/2019  6:29  PM|Pictures: How Things Have Changed|"
			Ahh, c'MON. You guys are missing out on a lot of interesting topics raised here by Mr. 2Big. You're letting your preconceptions about his nature and motives get in the way.
 


	So, I'm wondering:  Are there a lot of --or any -- of you hobbyists creating your own porn to fap to? As a memento? Or a trophy?
 


	If you are, I, for one, applaud your creativity and initiative! But, here's the deal. Even though I am a chiseled and extraordinary example of masculine hunkitude .... I sure as shit don't want to see myself  in the picture or video.  I mean I, like nearly everyone else I know, don't like the sound of my voice. Let alone the sight of my  (amazingly enormous and brass-like) balls wobbling around.  Or even my legendary and marvelous Ivory Tower o' Love. Even if a gorgeous example of beautiful femininity is writhig on good old Mr. Happy and making primal love moans while doing so.
 


	Plus, as a semi-pro photographer, I'd get all distracted by angles and lighting and framing, and, frankly, those are things I don't want to be considering while I am busy doing the Wild Thang. And then, the only angles I could truly find erotic would be with the lovely lady doing reverse cow girl. Still, I wouldn't want to really think about the way my Package of Deelight looks as I thrust manfully and enthusiastically into said goddess. As for porno material, nah, don't think it'd really work for me. In fact, one of the most distracting elements in amateur porn is some chump gasping or breathing heavily and gasping out stuff like, oh baby. 
 


	I don't want to be That Guy.
 


	Don't get me wrong! An attractive woman or women solo or duo: YES! Count me in!!! I will shoot any such erotic material at a seriously discounted rate. But with me in a starring role? It seems way too distracting during the event and a sure boner-killer afterward (despite my ripped and superhero-like physique). And seeing myself in the saddle? It is likely to make me much too self conscious. Anyone ever seen Lilya-4 Ever? It's an early 2000's movie about a Russian girl who ends up hooking in Sweden. There's a montage there of sweaty middle aged dudes that put me off hobbying for, like, oh, a day or two, or so it was so horrific. Flushed sweaty dudes pumping away. It would turn many a man celibate.
 


	But, yes, Mr. 2Big, I have noticed that women are much more likely to share nakey pics. Or wear revealing outfits and not really care if a nipple slips out. We live in marvelous times. And, a propos...I have a friend who's a well-regarded photographer, and nudes are a big part of his work. So, of course, I asked him one day: ""How did you get her [total art babe hottie] to pose for you?""
 


	His answer: ""I asked.""

	Suicide is the leading cause of death among kids his age in Colorado, and it is only getting worse. I've read a couple of places that everyone knows someone who is at risk.  That doesn't mean they will do it, it means they are at risk.  I'm attaching a couple of articles and I'm asking that everyone read them and to take some action.  Please find that person who is in you life and get involved. Make sure they know someone cares and make sure they have something to look forward to.  Believe me, the grief and guilt that comes from inaction is not something you want to try and live with.

	The loss is final and the devastation is complete.  They say the worst pain imaginable is the loss of a child, and they are correct. They say time heals wounds, but it has been over five months now and there has been no healing.  I didn't know it was possible to hurt this much and for this long, and don't want anyone on here to ever have to live through this. And they won't if I have anything to say about it. I didn't do what was necessary to save him and I have to try and find a way live with that, but you still can.
 


	I know I'm not the only person on this board to have to live with the loss of a child, but it would give me a little bit of peace to think there is a chance I could be the last.

			Although the situation is wrecking havoc to my income, hobby plans, life plans, and retirement plans, it is better to err on the side of caution since those things would also all be somewhat negatively impacted by my being dead. There is too much we do not yet know about covid-19. For example, more and more reports are surfacing about people who recovered, but are now testing positive again and \or getting sick again. Bad testing? Re-infection? Maybe. But also maybe...1) Maybe they never fully recovered. Ironically they are treating with Malaria meds. People with malignant Malaria NEVER fully recover and have flare ups all their life. What if covid-19 is that way too? 2) Perhaps there are 2 strains of the virus. Or 3. Or 10. The more people infected, the more chances for mutation. What if one mutation is 95% fatal? 3) HIV, Hep-C, Chicken Pox and others are retroviruses that mutate inside the body to evade and defeat the immune system. What if covid-19 has that capability? It is not impossible that everyone who gets it might eventually die of it. Now, I am not trying to be alarmist or foster FUD. The above 3 worst case scenario examples are extremely unlikely......But they are NOT impossible, and until medical science knows more they can't take the chance. That is why the extreme, painful, and catastrophically expensive measures are being taken

			""The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin."" - Ted Kaczynski
 


	This is why these tiny little rebellions against tyranny are important.  The 20th century was littered with examples of how people like me can be affected by people like you when you become too empowered.  At some point, I may no longer have the liberty to keep to myself and heckle humanity from a distance for my own amusement.  Even people like you eventually become victims of your own tyranny when things get bad enough.  Just as he futilely sacrificed his liberty in an attempt to save the world, I'm sacrificing my reputation here to try to enlighten you perverts.  That's not true, I'm doing it for the lulz.  I know I'm not going to get through to anybody.  That's the only difference between the two of us.  I realize you're all doomed and aren't worth saving anyway.  I do enjoy making a joke out of it, though.  To the point that it may be worth the aggravation that humanity caused me before I became too apathetic to care.  I'm quoting and comparing myself to the Unabomber.

			Well you need to hunt around for a newbie friendly provider,  who will accept what you are comfortable giving out. Tell her up front that you need to be able to get a reference from her, to build up your credentials. We all have to start somewhere. Most girls understand this. Read the reviews to look for one. This girl may not be exactly what you are looking for,  but it gets your foot in the door. She might also have a friend who will do the same for you. Then you have two references , with which you can use to see a girl you wanted to see to begin with.

			Cell phones, as long as they are powered up, stay in constant contact with the nearest tower. Even when they are turned off. Yes telecom companies keep this information. Google knows your locations by your internet use. The only way in the past,  was to physically remove the battery from your phone. That solution no longer exists. Removing the sim card does not stop the wifi from searching out networks as you move.  A RF bag is one solution. It blocks your phone from sending or receiving a signal. Now the quality of the bag needs to be factored into your decision. Some are better than others. Just remember you can't be contacted as long as it is sheilded.

If US citizens weren't allowed to travel abroad and foreigners where kept from coming here, then we would be better off.  I haven't heard much about North Korea.

			I do remember years ago a girl working out of a big RV in the KC area.   Though I never met her, the other guys said she would park in big parking lots, at the outer edges.

			It really doesn't matter much to me. As long as you are not being scrutinized by hotel staff or nosey neighbors, that is all I ask. Also that  your vehicle will be ok where you parked it.
 


	 The difference with a place of your own , is  how you can set  the mood. Scented candles, softer sheets,  decor, etc. More like real world dating. I had one girl who worked out of her actual apartment.  Not just one she got for the hobby. She was always running late, even working from home. Lol. We would sit and have a drink and talk first.

			No. The hobby is pay for play. So my standards won't change, as long as I am paying for it. I realize  that no matter what, we guys end up paying for it anyway.  In both the real and hobby world. In real world dating, the girls would have to lower their  bar,  like the ones in the vidieo. Because it will still cost me for dinners, drinks, etc. I might as well not settle.

			Well maybe big business could start testing their employees,  to see if they have had it and recovered. I know they would have to get test kits, but it is somewhere to start. Once enough people get tested and are working, there will be a need for restaurants and bars to take care of them. Air travel for business men . More gasoline for commuting.  Those who are maybe retired or in a high risk category, could stay inside a little longer by choice. 
 


	The thing about  staying shut down long, is business will evolve to work around the issues. At a job site the other day, I saw a vidieo building inspection done. It was only the plumber, but the guy had to do  like a facetime inspection vidieo. I think the inspector was working from his home because of the virus. Without travel time, he can probably do more inspections. So the city might downsize their staff. Other businesses will use technology  to downsize their operations. Maybe more will always work from home. So less building and hiway construction. People without work might never get the same kind of  good paying job back. Or maybe due to age or pre-existing conditions never get a job. So the quicker things start up, the better.

			Oh something else important - keep in mind that ""Total Cases"" doesn't mean the total number of coronavirus cases that actually exist (in the world or a given country), it means the total number of cases CONFIRMED BY TESTING. So the testing rate, or number of tests per million people, is important, because when the infection rate is high but the testing rate is low, it is likely that many cases are missed.
 


	As of March 9-10, some countries with HIGHER testing rates were:
 


	Bahrain, 4910 per million
 


	South Korea, 4099
 


	Hong Kong, 2134
 


	Italy, 1005
 


	Some countries with LOWER testing rates were:
 


	Japan, 76
 


	Netherlands, 35
 


	United States, 26
 


	Vietnam, 24
 


	Turkey, 10

	In a stark and urgent COVID-19 risk assessment update today, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that, in a few weeks or even days, other countries in the region may face huge surges that mirror those of China and Italy.
 


	It advised countries to quickly shift to mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable people and prevent overwhelmed hospitals.
 


	Reports of dire conditions in hospitals in Italy's hot spots have been circulating on social media for the past few weeks and are now appearing in medical journal and media reports. The ECDC acknowledges that high numbers of patients needing ventilation have exceeded intensive care unit (ICU) capacity in some healthcare facilities in northern Italy.
 


	Life-and-death decisions in Italy's inundated hospitals



	In a Lancet report today, two authors from Italy said the percentage of COVID-19 patients needing ICU treatment has ranged from 9% to 11% and that ICUs will be at maximum capacity if that trend continues for 1 more week. They predicted that Italy will need 4,000 more ICU beds over the next month, a challenge given that the country has about 5,200 ICU beds.
 


	In the hard-hit Lombardy region, healthcare workers have been working around the clock. About 350 (20%) have been infected, and some have died, according to the report. Italy's government is considering hiring 20,000 more medical workers and providing 5,000 more ventilators. Unless the measures are implemented in the next few days, they wrote, otherwise-avoidable deaths will occur.
 


	""Intensive care specialists are already considering denying life-saving care to the sickest and giving priority to those patients most likely to survive when deciding who to provide ventilation to,"" they wrote. ""In the near future, they will have no choice. They will have to follow the same rules that health-care workers are left with in conflict and disaster zones.""
 


	Countries on track for Hubei scenarios, ECDC warns



	In its assessment today, the ECDC said the risk of severe disease is moderate for the general population but high for older people and those with underlying medical conditions. Increased community transmission may exceed health system capacities in the coming weeks, it said, and countries should act now to step up hospital infection control and surge capacity.
 


	The ECDC said estimates for hospital care suggest that most European countries could reach Hubei province scenarios by the end of March, with all countries reaching that point by mid-April.
 


	The group urged member countries to implement social distancing measures such as cancelling mass gatherings and cordoning off hotspots early to slow outbreaks and give health systems more time to prepare for an influx of patients.
 


	The ECDC also recommended that countries designate COVID-19 facilities to minimize the transmission to other patients and conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and identify facilities for managing those with milder symptoms. When resources are stretched or limited, the ECDC said countries should take rational approaches to conserve testing, contact tracing, PPE use, and hospitalization for high-yield situations.
 


	Italy's health ministry today reported 2,651 new cases and 189 more deaths, raising its respective totals to 15,113 cases and 1,016 deaths. Spain's total today rose to 3,126 cases, with the addition of 782 more today. France's total rising to 2,876, with the addition of 595 more. The United Kingdom reported 134 new cases, boosting its total to 590.
 


	Several European countries announced more steps to curb the spread of the virus. For example, Slovakia declared a state of emergency and shut schools and major airports, and the Netherlands banned events of more than 100 people and urged citizens to work from home, if possible.

			Sorry, that number 15 million fatalities is totally wrong, way too high. The estimates I found for deaths from the 2009/2010 H1N1 epidemic are 150,000 to 600,000 worldwide and 9,000 to 18,000 in the United States. And about 10 % to 20 % of the entire world population of 6.8 billion caught the H1N1 flu.
 


	Since 0.68 billion to 1.36 billion people had the illness, and 150,000 to 600,000 died from it, the fatality rate was 0.01% to 0.09 % (or between 1 in 10,000 and 9 in 10,000). The fatality rate of COVID-19 is currently estimated to be 2 %, which is obviously a lot higher.
 


	However, the 2009/2010 pandemic had one unusual / scary feature (compared to typical flu epidemics) - it killed young people a lot more. About 80% of fatalities were under 65 years old, while for typical flu only 20% of the fatalities are under 65.
 


	People with high risk from COVID-19 are described as ""older adults"" (over 60), or with existing chronic medical conditions including heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes. Smokers are also at high risk.

			That the ratio of deaths to infections confirmed by testing. Testing is very incomplete so the true rate may be lower. But even if the rate is ""only"" 2%, that's 20 times worse than a flu epidemic, which is really bad (flu kills a lot of people).
 


	Also, some other pre-existing illnesses greatly increase the risk of death. I found the following:
 


	Death rate from COVID-19, depending on pre-existing condition:
 


	+ cardiovascular disease: 10.5 %
 


	+ diabetes: 7.3 %
 


	+ chronic respiratory (lung) disease: 6.3 %
 


	+ high blood pressure: 6.0 %
 


	+ cancer: 5.6 %
 


	no pre-existing serious illness: 0.9 %

			I question some of the above. Death rates from most flu varieties are 0.1 % (1 in 1000) and that hasn't changed in a long time. Also (unfortunately for older people) the death rate from flu, and also from COVID-19, increases rapidly with age above 60.
 


	There was one flu epidemic that was much deadlier - the ""Spanish flu"" of 1918-1919. That had one especially scary aspect - the death rate among young and middle-aged adults was as high as among the elderly. That virus had a mutation that caused it to provoke an extreme over-reaction of the immune system in many people (look up ""cytokine storm"") and the immune over-reaction itself was the cause of death. Fortunately that behavior hasn't been seen again in any viral epidemic since then.
 


	I've read that the worldwide number of deaths from the Spanish flu isn't known because the record-keeping was so poor. Estimates are ""from 17 million to 100 million"". Yikes! That's partly because it occurred at the end of World War I when many governments and nations were on the verge of collapse.
 


	The reason Spanish flu is called Spanish flu is also interesting. It definitely didn't start in Spain. But most European nations were under wartime censorship and their governments simply suppressed news of the epidemic and deaths. In 1918 Spain was not in the war, and had a relatively free press. When the flu reached Spain from France in November 1918, newspapers there were allowed to carry articles about it.

	How the War on Sex Work Crushes Underprivileged Women
 


	Maggie McNeill  |  From the March 2020 issue 


	
		That prohibitionist laws are always, always, enforced more heavily upon the poor, the disadvantaged, and minorities is not, I think, controversial. One would have to contort one's brain in a manner worthy of a Cirque du Soleil performance to ignore the facts that cops more heavily patrol poor and minority neighborhoods and actively look for people to arrest; that judges and juries have less sympathy for those they perceive as ""others""; and that, because poor people overwhelmingly lack the resources to mount an adequate criminal defense (or even bail), they are far more likely to plead guilty to whatever a prosecutor offers, just so they can get it over with and at least try to get back to their lives. Protectionist laws (including occupational licensing) similarly harm those who are not yet established in a field, since nonincumbents are less likely to be consulted about the content of those laws and far less likely to be able to afford compliance costs after the regulations take effect. 
	 

	
		These are among the reasons sex workers almost universally prefer prostitution ""decriminalization"" to the regulatory systems characteristic of what is called ""legalization."" The former‚Äîunlike so-called drug decriminalization‚Äîtakes sex work out of the hands of the police altogether, while the latter plants a thicket of special sex-work-specific rules, regulations, laws, licenses, permits, codes, and prohibitions that invariably creates a two-tiered system: one for those who have the money, knowhow, political or business connections, and other resources to comply and thus function ""legally,"" and one for those who do not. In every country with a ""legalized"" system, we see the same pattern: Well-connected businesspeople who have never themselves done sex work buy up all the brothel licenses, while racial or gender minorities, migrants, and other disadvantaged groups are far more likely to be arrested for working illegally within that ""legal"" system‚Äîoften for violating the same kinds of ridiculous and unnecessary rules that governments love foisting upon industries to which politicians or the cartels who own them have taken a dislike.
	 

	
		Even within the fully criminalized systems typical in the United States, there are glaring disparities of enforcement. Most of y'all reading this probably already know that while white and nonwhite Americans use recreational drugs at roughly equal rates, minorities are arrested more frequently, charged more heavily, and more frequently caged (and for longer terms). And most of y'all can probably guess that it's the same with sex work: While there are sex workers and clients of every description, sex workers of color, trans sex workers, and street workers are dramatically more likely to be hassled, arrested, and even robbed or raped by police than their white, cisgender, and indoor-working counterparts. Black trans street workers, falling into all of these groups, practically have targets painted on their backs; they're often arrested merely for daring to show their faces outdoors, a phenomenon that activists call ""walking while trans."" The same is true for their clients: Poor minority men who can only afford the (generally lower-priced) services of street workers are far more likely to be ensnared by policewomen looking to entrap them into committing a crime than are affluent white men who visit ""high-end"" escorts who discreetly do business in apartments or houses in ""nice"" neighborhoods. In one raid a few years ago, nearly every surname of the men arrested in a ""john sting"" in Seattle was Hispanic, despite the fact that Seattle is, to put it politely, much less ethnically diverse than most U.S. cities.
	 

	
		Just as poverty, minority status, and other disadvantages make people more vulnerable to the predations of police and prosecutors, so too do such attributes expose them to a greater likelihood of exploitation by criminals and unscrupulous businesspeople who don't quite qualify as criminals (but are bad enough). Disadvantaged sex workers face a greater likelihood of violence from people‚Äîwhether law enforcement or civilian sexual predators‚Äîposing as clients. And they usually lack the resources to set themselves up as indoor escorts, which requires things like professional photos, quality lingerie, a professional-looking website, advertising, beauty treatments, the rent for an ""incall"" location in a neighborhood wealthier men won't be afraid to visit, the cost of a dependable car for doing ""outcalls""‚ÄîI could go on, but I suspect you get the picture.
	 

	
		It shouldn't be surprising that, in desperation, some women will become involved with smooth-talking boyfriends or other middlemen who promise to help them access those things and thereby move off the street into a safer mode of work. But often, the boyfriend is a liar, or the middleman wants more money or more control than the sex worker anticipated, and before she knows it she finds herself in an exploitative or abusive situation. Both the frequency and the severity of such situations have been outrageously exaggerated by moralists, who liberally bandy about the label ""sex trafficking,"" who characterize the workers involved as passive victims rather than rational actors trying to do the best they can with very limited options, and who pretend that exploitation is the norm in our trade rather than an outlier (and an occurrence that would be even less common in the absence of prohibition). Nonetheless, as you can imagine, these situations are more common among poor women, migrants, underage sex workers, and so on.
	 

	
		The artificial hysteria around ""sex trafficking"" has made it an effective excuse for any oppressive law the government wants to pass, beginning with more money for cops and expanding into mass surveillance, greater restrictions on women's movement in public, and‚Äîperhaps most pernicious of all‚Äîinternet censorship.
	 

	
		In March 2018, Congress passed a legislative package colloquially known as FOSTA-SESTA and formally known as the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act and the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act. Even before President Donald Trump signed it into law a few weeks later, it had done tremendous damage to the sex work ecosystem.
	 

	
		The law makes a web platform liable for ""facilitating prostitution"" and ""sex trafficking"" (neither of which it defines adequately) if someone uses it to advertise illegal services. The chilling effect was dramatic; the majority of sites frequented by sex workers immediately shut down, closed themselves off to U.S. visitors, enacted draconian censorship policies, or‚Äîif the site's entire business model was based in sex work advertising, as with industry leader Eros.com‚Äîestablished a series of continually changing, increasingly incomprehensible, and confusingly silly rules about the types of pictures, links, and words that would be allowed. At about the same time, the feds shut down Backpage, the colossus of inexpensive sex work ads; its former owners have been subjected to a campaign of persecution that has not yet run its course.
	 

	
		Almost overnight, the industry was thrown into chaos worldwide. Although it was founded by Americans, Backpage was popular in Australia and many other places where prostitution is legal to one degree or another. Sex workers in those countries were forced to scramble for new ways to advertise their services. In some cases, they opted to build their own websites, domiciled and hosted in countries beyond the reach of American puritanism.
	 

	
		In the United States, the consequences have been nothing less than catastrophic. Many disadvantaged sex workers were forced to return to street work. Some younger women who had never worked without online ads were pushed to the street for the first time, placing them in far greater danger than either their indoor-working sisters or the older outdoor workers who at least knew what to expect. Naturally, ""not in my backyard"" (NIMBY) interests reacted badly to the increasing number of street workers, and many police departments have responded with more raids and arrests on popular strolls.
	 

	
		Other U.S. sex workers were able to scrape together the resources to move to more expensive ad sites, such as the aforementioned Eros. But the personal information that platform now demands that advertisers share‚Äîscans of a photo ID with legal name clearly displayed, full-face photos in the same outfits used in face-blurred ad shots, etc.‚Äîhave become so terrifyingly invasive that many established escorts, myself included, have abandoned it on the theory that the company may be amassing data to offer as a bargaining chip when the feds come after it, as the Department of Justice has already indicated it will.
	 

	
		Even those who have succeeded in moving into more ""upscale"" forms of work have a big problem: In recent years, U.S. law enforcement agencies have been adopting the faux-feminist ""end demand"" model of prohibition, which involves prosecuting clients more heavily than sex workers. A goal of this strategy is to win the support of carceral feminists who can't or won't comprehend that attacking a business's clients is an attack on the business, regardless of rhetoric.
	 

	
		The shift has understandably made potential clients much warier that the ""escort"" behind an ad might actually be a gang of cops out to ruin their lives‚Äîand that in turn has made many men more reluctant to provide the personal information that sex workers use to screen potential customers. Of course, established providers will generally have a considerable online footprint (ratings and reviews, a blog or Twitter account, a personal website, videos, searchable pictures‚Äîeven articles in libertarian magazines!) that would-be clients can examine to help them be sure a sex worker is the real McCoy and not a trap. More mature ladies also generally have a healthy number of regular clients built up over years. I'll be just fine, for example‚Äîand every time I'm quoted in an interview or appear in a documentary, I get more requests for dates.
	 

	
		You know who isn't likely to have such an unmistakably real internet presence? Those who are trying to move indoors from the street. Those who used to take out cheap Backpage ads and don't have their own professional websites. Part-timers who can't be too conspicuous about their side hustle for fear of losing their day jobs (or their kids). Those who were new to the industry when FOSTA-SESTA hit. 
	 

	
		In short, the disadvantaged. And so, as is always the case, the effects of prohibition and policing fall most heavily on those members of society who already suffer far more than their share of misfortune and violence.

			I travel to China several times a year on business.  About the only real safe places now to try and meet escorts is in the upscale hotels.....easy to find companionship with bartenders that will hook you up. I strongly suggest avoiding any other venues to find escorts or activities including the salons and massage parlors. Things are really changing over there with many things and not for the good either. It‚Äôs getting very dangerous for Westerners in my opinion. I tried to give this same advice to someone I know recently but he ignored the tips. He was robbed at knifepoint in Shanghai and got a pretty good beating afterwards.

			So yesterday I made an appointment with a provider that has all yes references with good comments. Great communication but upon getting there she is running late and offers a friend which I decline and decide to wait for her. No problem at all on my end as things happen as well all know. Anyway......as I am waiting from a very tactical position, 2 Sheriff SUV's move into the lot and I am out of there telling the provider what's going on.  Driving off another Sheriff car was headed down the road towards the incall. Quite fast I'd add  
 


	I am not saying it was related to this provider but I got to wondering about the whole incident. When I got home I did a Google search of the number and it pulled up multiple listings (yea I should've checked that prior). I guess if I had a giant set of balls I would've walked on in Lol.

	If it were up to me, I would impose a hard lockdown at least until the end of August. Shelter in place, only go outside for absolutely essential errands.

	For all the stupid people in this thread who seem to have slept through their statistics and science classes and who say: well, if you want to stay safe, just you shelter at home, then. The point of a quarantine is not that the people in quarantine are safe, rather, it's that the people outside are safe from those quarantined. Do you imbeciles not get this? If everyone stays home, nobody can infect anyone, and Covid-19 is gone in no time.
 


	IOW: Me staying home makes the world safer FROM me and safer for YOU.

			But this is exactly the problem: there is no such thing as ""when the dust settles"". There is never going to be an official announcement: Ladies and Gentlemen, it's now safe to return to doing what you did before. IOW, the risk factor is going to be sky high for years to come. It'll be your choice whether you might want to end up in the icu hooked up to a respirator, taking your last dying breath. 
 


	Back to the ""other options"" question: webcamming is extremely competitive, and anyone who thinks they can make quick money, just by firing up their computer's video cam is going to be in for a rude awakening. There is a metric fuckton of camsites out there with thousands of women competing for a guy's $.
 


	Also, most ladies on here can't compete with the 20 something Romanian girl who is sticking 6 dildoes out of her azz. Camsites have been completely flooded with girls from Eastern Europe. 
 


	Onlyfans, etc. - yeah, sure, but you gotta start producing highest quality content. On the regular. 
 


	In short: developing alternative options within the sex industry is close to impossible. 
 


	Don't count on it as a way to generate a sustainable income.

			This is why I tell my clients to contact ME FIRST so I am ready to give the reference for the provider you are interested in. Also, a good portion of us ladies don't just use references and P411 for screening so keep that in mind when you want to sign up thinking that it is going to get you through our door for an appointment.

			I used to be cool about hhr, but the last two years I kept getting a huge number of clients trying to be cheap, want everything on the menu in a short time,  be bad about last minute appts with canceling at the last minute or NCNS me. I am over them! Not sure what changed, but it wasn't for the better, and so I no longer provide them unless you have regularly seen me.
 


	The concept can be a good thing for clients that have a small window, on a tight budget, or just tend to be on the quick side, and for providers that are on location and willing to see more than one client a day.
 


	My personal life has changed though, and my feelings about what I want in this industry changed dramatically in the last few months as well so I want an hour or more, and I want it to be an experience. I know some ladies that feel similarly to this as well.
 


	I think providers and clients should do what feels best for them, and understand that each time has its own set of things that make them work uniquely for each individual depending on their need/want. That is the beautiful thing about this biz...the variety!

			This is one of the few reasons that I do not answer any phone calls until they have screened. For one, I am not having a prospective client think he can convince me to see him without screening(and they try by calling me instead of filling out my form), also I only want to waste my time talking to clients whom I have already seen  or gone through my screening because they are top priority, also yeah, it is to avoid the wives/girlfriends, and I really don't like being on the phone unless I have to.
 


	I have had the wives call, and I just act stupid like I have no idea who she is talking about or what she is referring to. Like you said, it isn't your place to be in the middle, and he has no one but his stupid ass to blame but himself. Drop him and block him. Make sure(just in case you weren't doing this) that in the future, that they pick you up somewhere generic so they don't have your address. Safety should always be top priority for your well being.

			UGH!! THIS right here is why fewer ladies are coming to Fort Collins...the guys get spooked by a few stings, and think even us legit ladies(that have regularly frequented your city) are too risky to STILL see. I had been going to Fort Collins for over 10 years, and this last year has been pretty sad with each visit. It has made me ponder going up that way again as it costs me precious money I just can't afford to waste, and I am not the only lady in this predicament. Also, I get the worst time wasters there too, and have heard the same from a few other ladies.  The few that I still regularly see have been a blessing, and I am grateful they are still willing to weather the storm...thank you so much for being awesome clients.
 


	If you seriously want to see any of us ladies in your area, screen a lady of your choice and preschedule with her. She will be more likely to come up there, and you get to have the time of your life. Getting us to your city starts with you guys showing you want us there.

			The lockdown is frought with more problems than I have patience or capacity to elaborate in a post. Also, this decision is so far above my pay grade, I hesitate to even ponder it. That said,  I think many are familiar with the lockdowns' first problem : it doesn't really solve spread, it slows it. Common sense says it also saves lives by not overwhelming medical capacity. However, given a whole bunch a bad science, rediculous computer modeling  and panic, we'll really never know. Unfortunately,  Corona virus, contrary to some hopes, will not burn itself out. In the long run, the benefits the lockdown buys us are relatively insignificant when compared to the destructive potential of an extended economic shutdown. This is in addition to the damage done to us as a society by petty tyrants who emerge, but I digress. This is not to minimize that thankfully, we do know more about the virus than we did a month ago. And yes, there have been some miraculous saves which I hope will continue. But, will there be widely available, convenient and cost effective individual virus screening, reliable immunity testing or vaccine in two months?  Three? Twelve?  Doubtful. What I have steadfastly maintained throughout is "" I hope to god the patient survives this treatment,""  because many are already ruined and in three more months, the damage will be incalculable. I'm prepared to live in a world filled with risks. I do it every day. Given what I know today, I'll continue to be very cautious going forward. I'll wash my hands, try not to chew my cuticles and minimize crowds. There is likely no getting out of this without paying a heavy price. Rhetorically speaking,  what's your price?

People of all ages can become infected and transmit the virus. Age is a factor in the course of the disease and outcomes. Simply put, if you're over 65 and you do contract the virus, you're more likely to die.  If you're going to continue to see people, your restriction on prior travel makes sense but just barely.

			As stated above, do a search on TOB with the keywords ""Newbie friendly"". Be prepared for screening. Most of the ladies that are newbie friendly will require some form of screening.
 


	Different ladies have different screening methods.  Be prepared to follow any of the screening that a lady requests.  If you are unwilling to follow her screening protocol, move on to the next lady on your radar.
 


	I wouldn't send a photo of your ID unless you black out pertinent personal information.  She may ask where you work so she can call and ask for you.  She may ask for social media information.  She may not ask for any screening at all.
 


	Since you have been a member for a long time and have been following the board,s you should know how to keep yourself safe from scams.
 


	Good luck and happy hobbying.

			If we wait for a vaccine before we reopen, that could take up to 2 years from estimates by the experts.

			Yes, the cell companies do.  But knowing which tower it pinged (my best understanding of accuracy usually available, large area) and knowing where it was within a few feet are two entirely different levels.  Let alone the ability to connect all other phones that were near yours and how long.  And no court order needed.

			For cell phone turn off the gps function in phone and WIFI.  Just be willing to trade not being able to find nearest parking or restaurant or use maps etc.  Without the gps or WIFI they can't track.  If you really need those functions, turn back on, use, turn off.  Simple.
 


	@bit banger  The original horse left the barn a long time ago, but Google and Apple are working in partnership on app specifically to track virus and contacts. The data collected would be yours AND those within a small distance of you for any length of time.  Both claim you can opt out.  It will probably be an ""update"" to the operating systems soon if not already.  Again turn off gps.
 


	As far as drones, cameras on light poles and all the rest that result in photos, face recognition, tracking all when you are in public is nothing remotely new other than better technology.  There has never been any expectation of privacy in public places.  It just used to be very labor intensive to do surveillance.

			Actually you can change your party affiliation on voting record just prior to whatever primary you wish to vote in, but only one per election cycle.  And that is In my opinion one of the absolute worst and most illogical voting laws ever.  Except for doing away with electoral vote.   Why should non-members of ANY party get to vote on who that party's candidate is?  There is significant incentive if your party has a shoo-in to cross over and vote for the worst, least electable one that has a chance to win primary but your real candidate is likely to kill in the general.  We wouldn't put up the worst candidates, would we?  Shit show of 2016.

			Have you ever actually read a ballot?  There are MULTIPLE other parties, and in some cases like Wallace and Perot they even garnered a significant percentage of the vote.  Perot even had a legit chance to win until he flew off the rails about alien abductions, etc.  If anyone wants to change and improve the continuous shit show we have from BOTH worthless parties the only way is to stop accepting the insane bullshit common ""wisdom"" that a third party candidate can't win and start to VOTE for one of the alternatives.

			The question is where is the tipping point?  Was it worth a month shut down to save lives and get our shit together a little better before peak?  Yes, undoubtedly.  Would it likely turn into anarchy for lack or work/money/food/shelter beyond say 6 months?  Yes, I think it could.  The hard truth in my opinion is restrictions need to be loosened significantly in any region where the hospital admission rate has dropped for seven or more consecutive days OR June 1, whichever comes first.  Someone and something has to generate revenue and assets, simple as that.  I fear beyond June we would cause irreparable harm to the country.  Devil's choice, but no worse than the choices if the peak exceeds medical resources and the big choice becomes who gets medical attention and who is simply ""made comfortable"" (drugged out of mind) and left to die.  It is a shit hand we were dealt and that has been poorly played on top.  Then get the testing for disease and anti-bodies actually available region/nationwide, not let the federal bureaucracy delay vaccine forever, prepare better for the next one that we know is coming, and probably make some major permanent changes relative to international travel, cruise ships, old folks homes and other death traps.
 


	Short answer, when hospital admissions dip for 7 days or June 1, whichever comes first.

			I can tell you from experience there are a number of things an ugly guy can do to up their game. never send a picture to a provider. tell her your stylist was talking about how dangerous it is to send pictures on line, because what ugly guy has a ""stylist"" right? at the hotel always park on the end with no windows, this gets you inside without being spotted. once inside approaching the room, high collar, hat, and sunglasses are your wing men. once you get in the door, this is when you make your move to turn the lights off! if she asks about the lights, you can't tell her it's because you're ugly so make something up like it's more romantic. you may be thinking once the session is up it's time to turn the lights on but you would be wrong. an ugly guy reference will really make your hobby days tough so you will need to learn to get dressed in the dark. while getting dressed and finding your wing men you can ask about a reference. when she opens the door remember collar up and face down into the hallway. once out the door make a run for the stairs. if you wait for the elevator and she comes out she might get a good look at your face and you can kiss that reference goodbye. I've had a lot of sex as an ugly guy but none of it was with the lights on.

	Get references before submitting a review or you would be sent this... 
	The system has flagged your review and it was denied. 
	Please obtain a ""TOB REFERENCE"" from a provider that already has a review history with us. (3 or more reviews) 
	Once she approves your ""TOB REFERENCE"" resubmit the review and include a note in the Admin area of the review that you've obtained a TOB REFERENCE. 
	To obtain a tob reference do this, go to the providers page click the blue button that says Request Reference. Once you do that we suggest you immediately follow up with the providers and let them know it is awaiting their approval. 
	NOTE: Always obtain references for any positive reviews you submit.

			I have a bunch of natural bars of soap in a glass bowl. Have been thinking about this problem  and  decided that if anyone uses a bar instead of the liquid soap in my shower? I will take the bar of soap and place  it in a ziplock bag for the guy to take home. Due to thinking it is unsanitary  and messy yuck in the shower. Had to take a fork to the soap to cut it free from the shower shelf last time.  Really yucky! ü§¢

			Watch your surroundings and physically protect yourself and items on you (purses, wallets). Also be careful with internet purchases.  Just watching you physical movements with social distance is not enough!  
	 
 


	Lots of purified water, green tea,. Wheat grass and whole lemons ,turmeric , coffee-trying to cut back on coffee damn! It‚Äôs  my only vice! 
 


	walking like crazy, fresh air, meditation , chanting, praying, placing a ‚Äúfirewall of protection‚Äù  around yourself and those you love daily (contact me if you wish on that exercise). Tell your loved ones how much you love them and how important they are to you, Gratitude,  humorous fun with friends is priceless and healing!

	As an artist I always like to improve my craft. I am very curious what you all find satisfying with all your exchanges  here on TOB :-D.
 


	Let me start by saying what DOESN""T matter to me are pics of how hot you are or  of certain body parts. Also if you are the ruler of 5 foreign countries .
 


	What I tend to look for is consistent and complete communication in a timely fashion. Respect for time and expectations. Cleanliness and hygiene ( although a nice cologne is a real bonus!!!) Genuine desire to please in mannerism and actions. Brevity and fun!
 


	I'd love to hear from both sides  just as a curiosity and way of getting to know you better!
 


	Happy holidays,

	The ultimate point I meant to present was that the only way to find out what true beginning looks like is to wipe the nastiest virus on the face of the planet from existence. The problem is that it's extraordinarily resolute. The solution is simply to remove the earth, it's moon, the sun and everything else around it, from the existence. The only way I can think of to do that, with my tiny Cro-Magnon brain is to re-create what the ancient Scandinavians called Ragnarok. The most of us will be swallowed alive.

			Audrey, based on the limited information I have of you, I think you're a good human being. I don't know what the perfect solution is. I can say, not everyone has everyone's best interests at heart. It's touchy. But at the end of the day, the Gods of ToB have decreed that ladies have the last word. I don't know if that's good or bad. I do know it opens the door for abusive slander. But that happens in both directions. At the end of the day, I think the real journey is to find treasure. Scrape through all the mud and discover souls who are genuine, even through their imperfections, practical and idealistic. Souls that heal the broken, or souls that try. It's not just a thing we search for here. It's treasure, because it's almost impossible to find.
 


	 
 


	Good luck. If you ever find such a thing in another human being. Hang onto them. Hang on with all your might.

			Yeah, I don't like that nasty wasp either, but that's not an answer. Please say something that's not a quote. Bit has a point.

			Here's where I see this backfiring.
 


	A client by the name of Yore A. Ness, sets eyes on beautiful Jenna Talia. Some phone calls get made, an appointment gets set, and a union with Jenna Talia and Yore A. Ness is imminent.
 


	Things ultimately turn south. Jenna and Yore prove to be a poor fit.
 


	Yore writes a review on the Jenna Talia we're talking about here, and it's less than flattering.
 


	Now Jenna is normally upright, straight forward and to the point. But this time no rebuttal gets written. Instead, she decides to plot revenge. She'll wait three weeks. Mind you, nobody knows Jenna Talia and Yore A. Ness ever came in contact. So Jenna calls one of the other women on his review list and pretends like she's looking for a reference. 
 


	Normally, in the regular working world, by law I think the only thing a company can divulge on their employees is confirmation that they've worked there and at what time. Seriously, though, who really abides by that?
 


	""So we got a resume sent to us from one of your employees. What can you tell me about Yore A. Ness?""
 


	""He's a hard worker. He really tries, but I gotta tell you. The other day, at the urinal, I couldn't help but notice. He's got a tiny dick.""
 


	""What?!""
 


	""I know what you're thinking. We're in sales. That's just not going to work. BUT, he does try and I don't know, you're a smaller organization. Maybe Yore A. Ness is a better fit for your staff.""
 


	So, Jenna Talia plows forward to the next lady on the list. There's a similar reference phone call.
 


	""You know he really is efficient. Keeps the workflow tight. But...""
 


	""But?""
 


	""He's kind of strange. He wears a pentagram.""
 


	""Oh wow.""
 


	""Yeah, and one day he came in smelling like patchouli and Beefaroni. The man loves Beefaroni. I think he burns patchouli in his car before coming in. Normally, not a big deal, but some of the ladies on staff complained about it. We had a delicate matter on our hands. What with H.R. We couldn't approach him directly about it. I mean what do we do? And what's with the green? This guy dresses from head to toe in green. Not exactly our brand colors. But hey, you need a job done, Yore A. Ness will really put himself out there.""
 


	So armed with this intelligence, Jenna Talia heads straight for the Blacklist sites.
 


	J.T. : I heard he had his dick shot off in the war. He can't even make it.
 


	Skrump Shuss: Easy money.
 


	J.T. : He came to me once. Came in carrying this dove. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. He bit the head off of it like Ozzy Osbourne.
 


	Unicorn Luv: Whose Ozzy Osbourne?
 


	Alize: Holy shit. Did he look like Ozzy Osbourne? 
 


	J.T. : No. He looked more like a cross between Pippin Took and a can of green beans.
 


	Leeza Monique: Oh wow.
 


	J.T. : And he smelled like burning leaves and Taco Bell. I wanted to eat so bad.
 


	   
	Needless to say, after weeks of shut outs and sad lonely nights, he found comfort with a can of Beefaroni and the shameful jug of a Carlo Rossi, grocery store overstock. Yore A. Ness hung his spurs up that night to muse over old Veronica Lake pinups.
 


	""If I only had a time machine.""

			Maybe because they don‚Äôt want a spotlight on them. If a bunch of people get sick and have to get treated, (not just talking about clients, that includes the staff) questions are certainly going to get asked about where they‚Äôve been and who they‚Äôve contacted.

			Normally I would ignore this type of question.  Everyone else is always so nasty to someone who obviously has done little homework.  This reeks of danger.  Since I am in a shitty mood, I will take my shots at the op. 
   
 Been a member for 7 years and only posting this question now?  Seems very strange. Have you done any homework at all?  Have you checked any of the other sites beside BP and EB?  They are many, many more out there.  Join P411.  Sounds like you are a real cheap ass to.  What do you consider as rates being to high?   
   
 In 5 years I have seen at least 15 ladies in the Loveland, Fort Collins, Windsor and Greeley area.  Today, there are 11 ladies that I have either seen or have heard of that can be found on various sites.  Many others that I have not.   
   
 If you are LE, the question was one of the weakest I have ever seen.  If so, I know you can hack into my account here, so cut out the BS and leave the ladies alone. Do something to benefit society like patrolling I-25 and ticket all the damn truckers who clog the highways by driving in the left lane. 
   
 If you are not LE, you are just pitiful and cheap.

			As one of the older men on here at 69, yes that is fact so no snickers,  I started seeing ladies about 6 years ago.  It is probably somewhere around a total number of 50 and most of those in the first 5 years.  I have been with ladies from 23 to 59.  Those are ages, I know were correct.  I prefer ladies from 35 on up. However whatever their age, if you treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve, the younger ladies are glad to be with an older gentlemen.  Young or old, if you are a jerk and an ass, you will be treated like one. Why do you think so many ladies across the country will not see men under a certain age?  35 seems to be a popular number.  I am healthy, but damn sure not real fit, and have never had any complaints from any of the ladies I have had the pleasure to associate with.

			Tipping and upselling should have different boxes to check  To me, there is a obvious distinction.  If I remember correctly, I have tipped every lady I have been with in 4 years.  That would be somewhere around 50.  I have never had a lady upsell me.  I upsold myself a few times by extending the time of the session.  
   
 Personally, I do not see the problem with upselling if it is done in a civil manner.  The restaurant industry, among others teach their employees to upsell. That is how they increase their profits for specials. 
   
 My only beef would be if we agreed on X for services for A dollars. Before the session gets too far the lady states she will not do X without more dollars to perform Y services.  That is definitely upselling. 
   
 All the ladies I know are too classy for that.

 About 25 years ago, I was in charge of recruiting for a national accounting firm.  Their criteria was only look at those with 3.5+GPA.  My criteria was, most of those were educated beyond their intelligence; ie  no common sense.  This one individual had been hired in one of our other offices and was transferred to us.  I was reviewing hos work one time on a client who was in the horse business and bought and sold hundreds of horses each year.  In reviewing my young associates work, he consistently spelled ""Horse"" WHORES.  Not once, not twice, but throughout this spread sheet that was about to be sent to our client.   
   
 Needless to say, he did not last very long in our office.  Scary part was, he went to work at a very large bank in Denver.

It now greatly increases the prices of where the locals were living on the beach shores. The once generational subsistence life of the locals has now become impossible to live as the price structure has completely changed drastically because of a few hotels popping up. These locals live in ""untouristy conditions"" (eyesores) and will now be forced to relocate because they are an inconvenience to the common good of the new shift of tourism of where they once lived.

			Ok, so I don't get why guys show up to an appointment not being aware of their stink and gross hygiene? I also don't know how it's possible to skip washing your ass while being in the shower either?  How could someone be so oblivious of their repulsiveness? And it's with great probability these are the guys expecting full GFE. Probably a smoker with food in his teeth or beard. Completely oblivious that their breath is horrific when trying to ram their tongue down your throat. And all I can say is, I am sorry you ladies have to even deal with this! These kind of guys are complete retards and they should lose their poon cards without a doubt!
 


	But we have to be honest. This happens to us guys too. I am completely repulsed when a lady either has B.V., or isn't aware of their pongy hygiene, or it's obvious she didn't clean up well after a previous appointment.
 


	I was in Seattle in Feb. I was with 4 ladies. Two of these ladies were in this stinky category? And these ladies were tenured providers. One of these ladies odor was so overwhelming. I stopped and just talked to her with the rest of my time. I don't have kids. I am not a parent. I have not been exposed to crazy gross crap! When I smell repulsive odors, not sure if it's B.V. or ass? My boner goes away!  Fantasy ruined! I get it. I'm sheltered. But in the end, this is a subject I shouldn't have to explain to someone in this world of ours. 
 


	I don't understand how you ladies can move forward with a guy coming into an appointment just stinking? I know I can't and I don't. Bad breath, strong body odor, piss, feces, or stink because they are just dirty from the lack of a good shower/bath. But in fairness to this thread. It really does happen to us guys as well. And this experience really really sucks for anyone one of us in this exciting fantasy world of ours...‚Ä¶..

	I'm in Pueblo too. Not much going on locally unless you are into airhead doper chicks. Colorado Springs offers more opportunities but scheduling can be a hassle---lots of providers who are not responsive to texts or phone calls, and a 2 hour round-trip to meet a lady who turns ghost on you is a real drag. TOB ladies are generally more professional and reliable than some others. If you are looking elsewhere be careful of the fakes, verification scams, up front deposit schemes, bait and switch, and the rest of the nonsense out there. Real caveat emptor stuff going on.
 


	Check reviews, reach out to those who interest you, see what the responses are like, go from there. Good luck.

			Opening day! Woke up 2 hours before sunrise and got dressed. Made up a thermos of coffee, some sandwiches and snacks. Loaded up my gun and gear in the truck. Backed out of the garage. Wind was blowing something fierce! Freezing rain mixed with ice and sleet! It was absolutely horrible.
 


	Pulled back into the garage. Unloaded my gear. Crept back into the house, got undressed, slipped back into the bed.
 


	Snuggled up next to my wife and whispered ""The weather is awful out there"".
 


	""Yeah"", she replied, ""and if you can believe it my dumbass husband went hunting today"".

			For me the connection is essential. Met a great young lady in 2003, saw her 3 to 5 times per month for 7 years. Always had a pleasant visit, shared a lot of laughs, gifts at holidays and birthdays, and the physical side was always great. She married and moved away, now I usually get a short text on my birthday, and I send a short message near Xmas (her birthday is close). I wish her all the best in life.
 


	I haven't met another woman like that since, but I am still hoping.

			50 years later and I am still trying to find out who made the instant coffee packed in our C-ration boxes in Vietnam. That stuff had enough caffeine to raise the dead! The taste was actually pretty good, even though the venue lacked something in ambiance. Cutting a few small slices off a block of C4 plastique explosive to burn and heat water for your morning coffee, well you just can't duplicate that experience in modern America. The aluminum canteen cup was so much nicer than any paper or plastic contraption at today's coffee shop. Just in case I haven't mentioned it, the price was great! When Uncle Sam said you were going on an all expense paid vacation, that meant all expenses (transportation, food, clothing, medical care, ammunition, everything); beer was only $2.40 per case, cigarettes were $1.90 per carton, and Canadian Club whiskey was $1.90 per quart. Of course, refrigeration, air conditioning, and ice were in pretty short supply most of the time.
 


	So, occasionally my old mind wanders a bit.

	6.  never a dull moment--can keep up with the best of them--called stamina
 


	5.  I try to have a sense of humor at all times for a good balance that makes everything flow
 


	4.  google:  size matters--but maybe not for everyone--then why have they been saying--I want to mold it--want to take it home with me--well--you describe your dimensions
 


	3.  I feel fulfilled when I'm told--I wish I could give you 3 OKs or you are more than OK

			Ambiguous thoughts...would be fun for you guys and gals to add to this review:
 


	Maybe once in a persons life a rare experience happens that you want to savor the moment and that flavor in time, hoping it lasts forever!  You value it as the best--not just one of the best.  The atmosphere was inspiring, the service was just perfect.   Everything was cooked to perfection and delivered very attentively with the right amount of personal friendliness and humor as well. that can only be described like: service impeccable, flawless, innovative, discerning, sensational.  When you sense the meaning of ""made from scratch"" when asked ""anything you'd like to try"" you realize the originality of this very quaint locale, and tucked away cove-like setting, just perfect for intimate dining, both inside and out.  The best quality ingredients creates the love and excitement within, just as the landscape does before entering.  From start to finish, including the time set aside for unwinding and dessert, sets the mind for that superb service never to be forgotten experience.  For those with refined tastes and passion exuberant, I have to say it's a once in a lifetime experience.
 


	This deserves the Michelin Star--the highest honor and comes with my highest recommendation!  Well, I have to admit, the culmination of all the above has caused me to visit often, to the point of trying to remember how many times--although many--so the ""once in a lifetime didn't stop with one--like the old song,  ""Once you've had it, you never want to quit--is so true.

I'm tall at 6'4 so i don't get intimidated, i would have parked and casually walked over to the officer and inquired about the hub-bub, but that's me.

			I actually prefer an apartment or house to a hotel, but don't really care much either way as long as it is clean.  I would think that the only downside of using your apartment is that the clients know where you live, so that could be an issue.  The upside is that there is no additional expense, especially in the case of a NCNS.  All of my ATFs work out of their homes.  I know a couple of gals split an apartment that they don't actually live in, but that seems to always end in drama for some reason.

			It's actually simple:  We had to shut down for a couple of months because our leaders fucked around for a couple of months without making any preparations for the onslaught of sick people they knew (or would have known if they listened to the WHO, CDC and the intelligence community) were coming.  After a couple of months, when our incompetent leaders are done fucking around and we have the hospital beds ready and the respirators in hand, we will have to open up and let the chips (and bodies) fall where they may.
 


	If we had been ready, we wouldn't have had to shut down at all.
 


	Besides, its only the lower and middle classes that are suffering, which generally is of no consequence to those in charge.

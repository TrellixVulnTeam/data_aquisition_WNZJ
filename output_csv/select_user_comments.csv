			I’ve got the Covid right now...I think, they won’t test me though. I have most of the symptoms, but fortunately they’re are moderate at best so far. Once I’m out of quarantine, and symptom free for 2 weeks I’ll be immune and back out there hobbying again.




	i assume we will have providers contracting Covid soon as well. Hopefully they will quarantine till there well and not contagious.  I wonder, will we then see providers advertising as “Covid-friendly” ??

			The Gates backed company Moderna's vaccine that was fast tracked by Fauci has been being tested on humans for over a month. That is the vaccine that uses messenger RNA to give new instructions to your cells DNA to supposedly start producing antibodies. The lock downs, masks, and social distancing discussions will end 10 seconds after the vaccine start rolling off the lines. Count on the WHO and CDC to then immediately say that lock downs, masks, and social distancing are totally ineffective and the only hope is mandatory vaccination of ""everyone""  on Earth.

Some guys who may not be going to work, can't now get away from the old ball and chain. As another poster replied to you, some old ball and chains are not rolling off to work themselves. A fair number of guys are sitting out protecting their health, many have posted it here. Then a lot of business owners have been shut down, and workers laid off, so many people can't afford it.

			Many good points...specifically, the total absence of any news one can believe.....the constant changing of the story by CDC and WHO......and the insane double standards making regular life deadly and illegal, but protests and riots safe and admirable. It is UNDENIABLE that there is tons of bullshit and constant lies....just nobody can can prove WHAT is lies. Because nobody can prove what is lies, any preposterous lie , new claim, or change in narrative is branded the truth and anyone who does not believe it is a selfish, tin foil hat wearing, conspiracy theory embracing, racist , grandma killing, dumbass. I believe nothing I hear or read. I go out and buy necessities IF I can't get them delivered, and do it very rapidly and efficiently like a ""mission"". I refuse to go anyplace else, or spend a cent on anything else. This is NOT one iota of fear of covid induced....it is disgust with the human herd of lying, insane, sometimes violent idiots,  that I  refuse to look at or be near. Like swimming in the sewer.

			That is almost always true from a practical perspective, but not technically true. Due to the intimate nature of the hobby and the fact that everyone in it is a human being, it is unrealistic to think love is not going to happen sometimes. Occasionally clients fall for providers, providers fall for clients, and sometimes they fall in love with each other. I have had the good fortune to experience that last of those more than once. The PRACTICAL problem here is that almost everyone equates ""In Love"" with "" Now must be in relationship, almost certainly monogamous"".....that's when it all goes off the rails. HOWEVER, rarely, a small few people can be in love and NOT require that to = relationship......THAT is a special thing beyond description. That said, DO NOT go LOOKING for that.

			If the corporate sponsors do all the naming of teams, then they would have changed them years ago. They just buy naming rights to the stadiums. So far there are no Coors Silver Bullets.  I really could care less. I don't care about sports. No person should be paid tens of millions for throwing, carring, hitting or kicking a ball. I think the virus has proved we can do just as good without them. Most make local cities pay for  the stadiums, the teams could otherwise afford all by themselves.



	As for the statutes being about slavery on public property, you have a point. No one should see a statue of a slave.  If you are in that locallity and are paying taxes. All you need to do is get a pettion and ask to have them taken down. If you don't live there and don't  pay into the local taxes, well I don't think they will listen to you.  What if the people of some place outside of Colorado said you should ban all illegal  drug sales,  medical or recreational. I bet you in Colorado would them tell them where to go. That they have no rights interfering with you making your children drug addicts.

Alex Majors|07/05/2020 11:08  PM|Name change|"
			Personally, this is America and not some dictatorship.. If everyone who wants to change the name kicks in a few bucks, they can buy the team and call it whatever the hell they want. I am sure the owners can't turn down a lucrative offer. Everything solved and everyone is happy. Capiltalism at its best.   It is never good to force anyone,  to do anything you want, against their will. All it breeds is resentment.



	If some small Southern town has a memorial to the locals who fought in the Civil War, why does it bother you. Most of us probably have never  seen one in person.  I know I haven't. I for one am not going to tell them from hundreds of miles away, what they should do. I don't live there. By the same token,  they shouldn't be telling me who we should have as statues where Iive.



	Just like the Cultural Revolution in China in 1966, these kids are blindly following someone's agenda. If they do away with the law like they want , you could find yourself on the wrong end of mob rule. It didn't turn out so well for 712,000 Chinese,  who they executed on bogus charges.

			I believe we can all agree life is not fair.  There will always be someone who doesn't like you for one reason or another. Reparations. Just who should receive this payment? Those who had been slaves are long dead.  Where I live, 60% of my property taxes go to the public schools. I believe I have paid my fair share. Education is what allows you to succeed in life and keeps you  out of trouble.  They have excellent training for trades also.  It is provided free of charge but you have to be willing to want to learn.



	As for the question on why some cling to a certain symbol. I grew up in what is called the Burnt District,  along the border with Kansas.  My family arrived long after the Civil War, so it wasn't a part of my family's history  but I grew up with people whose families settled this area in the 1820's.  They were some of the few  who returned . All inhabitants in a 2,200 sq mile area, no matter which side they favored , were forced out of their homes, most of  their property conficated by Union troops and all buildings put to the torch. Just like those who lost property to the rioters and looters. Some take pride that their ancestors,  at least fought back against this injustice to them.   They had no slaves.

	Now we have had all these  highly paid doctors/scientists through time show they have no idea what they are doing. They took an educated guess because none of them have been in this position before. Their computer model predicted the sky was falling and everyone listened. Now the economy took a BIG hit. Yes people died but a lot of them were on that path to an early grave.  Our society is run by people with no common sense. For example I was talking to a nurse. Her hospital made a policy that if any worker traveled to a hot spot, they would have to self quarantine for 2 weeks. Even if they drove through  non-stop on the interstate at 65mph with the windows up. Yet they could eat lunch 6feet away in the cafeteria.  from nurses who work in the Covid wing. Yet they don't have to self quarantine because of that.

Then posted in another thread by mistake that she was in Oklahoma City. Ready to meet some friends.

			I agree. Multiple options for screening seems to work best for me too. Adding in a RW screening option has opened up possibilities to see newbies and clients who do not like to use their references for a variety a reasons.



	When I worked in my 20s, I never remember any controversy over references. Like you mentioned, I dont remember there being a competition issue either. I think it was mainly because internet escorting was new and we were all pretty excited about it and about helping each other.  I came back into the industry thinking it was the same.

	I do know what you're talking about though and I do think they are different than personal references, because at least with personal references we can let the providers know we don't remember them but we have this little note jotted down for them, and the provider can decide for themselves if that's good enough.  If I don't have any recollection at all for a client and it's been awhile, I would ask them to come back to see me for a reference on here. Thanks again for your post. It's a good reminder. ❤

			Not every client can see a provider every 30 days. Plus some providers request multiple references. In that case, not every client can see 2 or 3 providers within 30 days.



	That being said I like when providers publically post their reference sharing requirements. That way if clients dont plan on seeing another provider for a few months, they'll know not to use you as a reference, and there's no timewastimg involved for you, him or the providers he wishes to see.

			Based on the modeling.



	Public health experts, including Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have previously estimated that as many as 100,000 to 200,000 Americans could die from the novel coronavirus.



	The divergent Point 04/08/20



	https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/491715-key-coronavirus-model-revised-downward-predicts-60k-deaths-in-us-by-august



	Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [ IHME ] was on the CDC Web site and was a key forecasting model used by the ""White House"", IHME at that time had revised its prediction of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S.,  estimating a peak of 60,415 dead by early August 2020.



	IHME ---> The main Data Point was the strict adherence to a Nation wide stay-at-home order. sense that was never the case the updated modeling had to include Data where individuals are not adhering to the discipline of distancing.,



	Now then that projection scenario by October 1, 2020 was 175,168 COVID-19 deaths.



	https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america



	So the ""White House"" removed IHME's current forecasting data from the CDC website because it didn't fit the ""White House"" agenda.



	____________________________________________



	We are in the middle of this pandemic and as others have stated the modeling will change and update as more science driven data is known.




		Anthony Fauci's was accurate with his estimate that as many as 100,000 to 200,000 Americans could die from the novel coronavirus.


		Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [ IHME ] was accurate when the modeling included a strict adherence to a Nation wide stay-at-home order.


		Without a National directive all shit broke loose.



	Don't blame Anthony Fauci as his narrative has been consistent with the science driven data and has never flipped flopped.

			I graduated from Fort Lewis College,Durango,CO, 1988. While I attended school back in those days the mascot (sport teams) was called the Raiders. I never thought too much about it. Was kind of taken back when the college changed their sports name to the Sky Hawks. All I thought at the time was yes I think it was more fitting name due the campus sitting on top of mountain butte. The campus has very  picturesque views if you ever been  to Durango go vista the campus. Well for what it is worth. This name changing topic and yes possibly The Raiders (Fort Lewis’s former name) is not a very “nice” name for small college? I don’t know? I really don’t think too much about this sort of stuff. Other than I will be upset if Mount Rushmore is blown up. Stapleton- it will be interesting to see what name they come up with for their name change. Funny thing is all I can  remember about the old airport is that you had to put a coin in the toilet stall to use it. I must have been around 7 years old. - No need to do that at the new airport!

			My procedure is that I don’t require references to come and see me. . Seldom have I ever request information from a provider. I am not sure when the NEED for character  reference sharing even began? Kind of an interesting change from when I first started doing this. I also have my own style protocol for helping ladies and clientele out with their comfort needs. And yes I am reference friendly (My procedure is posted in my website) and as long as the gentleman approaches me first and it has not been so long that I don’t remember him 3 months if it has been only one visit. Just want to make sure I have the right “Steve, John, Mike”. Also, as long as I can find the provider listed somewhere? So I may confirm she is safe to confirm safe and legitimate we are golden. Also, please understand because this is an independent biz understanding that not everyone feels comfortable with helping other providers (speaking in general on other ladies needs). Please accept her boundaries with contact. Also, please understand that we all have our own personal comfort levels/understandings/ acceptances of others.
	Rolling with the times ladies and gentlemen! 🥰🤗.

			Helpful hints to find the clit...



		The clit looks like the head of a squirrel. It will have 2 eyes and little ears and a furry top. It will be located about 3 inches above the bunghole up the small of the back. If that does not work for you try the clitoris call. This is done by pinching your cheek and moving it rapidly back and forth. It will make a wet chirping sound like a squirrel and the clit will poke its head out when it hears that.  Happy clit hunting.

	Has TOB served it's purpose since it's inception 10 or twelve years ago? Are there other ""Otherboards"" that people are migrating to that I'm not aware of?  Someplace that isn't a cam site, OnlyFans or similar paysite?

If you don’t trust the provider with your personal information, why  are you seeing her? What on earth do we want to do with your name I mean really unless you do some shady shit, you have nothing to worry about. But yet men still believe that in this crazy world they can just walk into our homes with no information given and we are supposed to be ok with that. It’s frustrating but for every 3 that fight about it, there’s that one that makes it pleasantly easy. The wonderful part of this business is we have the power to decide who we see so those that don’t read or fight with us when it comes to screening will end up with some not so hot or reputable ladies and they can complain all they want but in the end... it’s nobody’s fault but their own. Those that give me trouble I just end the conversation, block (sometimes) and move on.  Some people just think rules don’t apply to them but it’s not worth the stress in my opinion

			Oh something else important - keep in mind that ""Total Cases"" doesn't mean the total number of coronavirus cases that actually exist (in the world or a given country), it means the total number of cases CONFIRMED BY TESTING. So the testing rate, or number of tests per million people, is important, because when the infection rate is high but the testing rate is low, it is likely that many cases are missed.



	As of March 9-10, some countries with HIGHER testing rates were:



	Bahrain, 4910 per million



	South Korea, 4099



	Hong Kong, 2134



	Italy, 1005



	Some countries with LOWER testing rates were:



	Japan, 76



	Netherlands, 35



	United States, 26



	Vietnam, 24



	Turkey, 10

			ECDC: COVID-19 not containable, set to overwhelm hospitals













											Filed Under:




												COVID-19









												Lisa Schnirring | News Editor | CIDRAP News



									 |




												Mar 12, 2020














	In a stark and urgent COVID-19 risk assessment update today, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that, in a few weeks or even days, other countries in the region may face huge surges that mirror those of China and Italy.



	It advised countries to quickly shift to mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable people and prevent overwhelmed hospitals.



	Reports of dire conditions in hospitals in Italy's hot spots have been circulating on social media for the past few weeks and are now appearing in medical journal and media reports. The ECDC acknowledges that high numbers of patients needing ventilation have exceeded intensive care unit (ICU) capacity in some healthcare facilities in northern Italy.



	Life-and-death decisions in Italy's inundated hospitals



	In a Lancet report today, two authors from Italy said the percentage of COVID-19 patients needing ICU treatment has ranged from 9% to 11% and that ICUs will be at maximum capacity if that trend continues for 1 more week. They predicted that Italy will need 4,000 more ICU beds over the next month, a challenge given that the country has about 5,200 ICU beds.



	In the hard-hit Lombardy region, healthcare workers have been working around the clock. About 350 (20%) have been infected, and some have died, according to the report. Italy's government is considering hiring 20,000 more medical workers and providing 5,000 more ventilators. Unless the measures are implemented in the next few days, they wrote, otherwise-avoidable deaths will occur.



	""Intensive care specialists are already considering denying life-saving care to the sickest and giving priority to those patients most likely to survive when deciding who to provide ventilation to,"" they wrote. ""In the near future, they will have no choice. They will have to follow the same rules that health-care workers are left with in conflict and disaster zones.""



	Countries on track for Hubei scenarios, ECDC warns



	In its assessment today, the ECDC said the risk of severe disease is moderate for the general population but high for older people and those with underlying medical conditions. Increased community transmission may exceed health system capacities in the coming weeks, it said, and countries should act now to step up hospital infection control and surge capacity.



	The ECDC said estimates for hospital care suggest that most European countries could reach Hubei province scenarios by the end of March, with all countries reaching that point by mid-April.



	The group urged member countries to implement social distancing measures such as cancelling mass gatherings and cordoning off hotspots early to slow outbreaks and give health systems more time to prepare for an influx of patients.



	The ECDC also recommended that countries designate COVID-19 facilities to minimize the transmission to other patients and conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and identify facilities for managing those with milder symptoms. When resources are stretched or limited, the ECDC said countries should take rational approaches to conserve testing, contact tracing, PPE use, and hospitalization for high-yield situations.



	Italy's health ministry today reported 2,651 new cases and 189 more deaths, raising its respective totals to 15,113 cases and 1,016 deaths. Spain's total today rose to 3,126 cases, with the addition of 782 more today. France's total rising to 2,876, with the addition of 595 more. The United Kingdom reported 134 new cases, boosting its total to 590.



	Several European countries announced more steps to curb the spread of the virus. For example, Slovakia declared a state of emergency and shut schools and major airports, and the Netherlands banned events of more than 100 people and urged citizens to work from home, if possible.

N6_in_the_village|03/11/2020  5:01  AM|Covid-19 (2019 novel coronavirus)|"
			Sorry, that number 15 million fatalities is totally wrong, way too high. The estimates I found for deaths from the 2009/2010 H1N1 epidemic are 150,000 to 600,000 worldwide and 9,000 to 18,000 in the United States. And about 10 % to 20 % of the entire world population of 6.8 billion caught the H1N1 flu.



	Since 0.68 billion to 1.36 billion people had the illness, and 150,000 to 600,000 died from it, the fatality rate was 0.01% to 0.09 % (or between 1 in 10,000 and 9 in 10,000). The fatality rate of COVID-19 is currently estimated to be 2 %, which is obviously a lot higher.



	However, the 2009/2010 pandemic had one unusual / scary feature (compared to typical flu epidemics) - it killed young people a lot more. About 80% of fatalities were under 65 years old, while for typical flu only 20% of the fatalities are under 65.



	People with high risk from COVID-19 are described as ""older adults"" (over 60), or with existing chronic medical conditions including heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes. Smokers are also at high risk.

			That the ratio of deaths to infections confirmed by testing. Testing is very incomplete so the true rate may be lower. But even if the rate is ""only"" 2%, that's 20 times worse than a flu epidemic, which is really bad (flu kills a lot of people).



	Also, some other pre-existing illnesses greatly increase the risk of death. I found the following:



	Death rate from COVID-19, depending on pre-existing condition:



	+ cardiovascular disease: 10.5 %



	+ diabetes: 7.3 %



	+ chronic respiratory (lung) disease: 6.3 %



	+ high blood pressure: 6.0 %



	+ cancer: 5.6 %



	no pre-existing serious illness: 0.9 %

		"
N6_in_the_village|03/05/2020 11:28  PM|Covid-19 (2019 novel coronavirus)|"
			I question some of the above. Death rates from most flu varieties are 0.1 % (1 in 1000) and that hasn't changed in a long time. Also (unfortunately for older people) the death rate from flu, and also from COVID-19, increases rapidly with age above 60.



	There was one flu epidemic that was much deadlier - the ""Spanish flu"" of 1918-1919. That had one especially scary aspect - the death rate among young and middle-aged adults was as high as among the elderly. That virus had a mutation that caused it to provoke an extreme over-reaction of the immune system in many people (look up ""cytokine storm"") and the immune over-reaction itself was the cause of death. Fortunately that behavior hasn't been seen again in any viral epidemic since then.



	I've read that the worldwide number of deaths from the Spanish flu isn't known because the record-keeping was so poor. Estimates are ""from 17 million to 100 million"". Yikes! That's partly because it occurred at the end of World War I when many governments and nations were on the verge of collapse.



	The reason Spanish flu is called Spanish flu is also interesting. It definitely didn't start in Spain. But most European nations were under wartime censorship and their governments simply suppressed news of the epidemic and deaths. In 1918 Spain was not in the war, and had a relatively free press. When the flu reached Spain from France in November 1918, newspapers there were allowed to carry articles about it.

I didn’t realize how many slutty women in complete denial there are around town. I’m looking better now. Being stuck at home working out everyday is doing my body good.

All I have to do is stay positive’  Now Is that something that comes naturally to you, thinking positive? Or do you have to try to think positive? What if I told you there was an easy way to stay happy and optimistic everyday of your life no matter how bad things got, and that it can be done in five simple exercises?




	Let me get back to my story. After the fourth or fifth person told me they love the show and that I should really check it out, I had to find out what all the buzz was about. I resolved to sit on the couch for twenty two minutes and watch a full episode of Friends.

	So far, Covid19 has killed about 3,000 globally. Certainly, more people will die — mostly the aged and those with compromised immune systems. For perspective,  80,000 Americans died last year from plain old influenza, according to the Centers for Disease Control.


	Cars kill 36,000 people every year. And yet, we still drive on I25 or I70 in search of love or pussy. And that’s some dangerous action, right there. We all balance risk and reward according to what we want.


	Apart from a few seniors and hypochondriacs, I’m not sure there’ll be a big hit to the hobby. I could be wrong. But I also remember the SARS hysteria, and while that was a big deal in Asia, in Colorado...not so much. At all.


	Just be sure to wash your hands properly and stay healthy.

	SARS: total of 8,000 cases and 800 deaths over entire course of the epidemic (high mortality rate, but didn't spread much).


	COVID-19: total of 87,000 cases total (mostly in China), 2,979 deaths (mostly in China), and 7,155 cases outside China, SO FAR.


	COVID-19 looks like the more serious problem from information we have to date.


	One thing that may actually make COVID-19 worse than SARS - as an epidemic - is that the large majority of people with the illness show only mild symptoms. But they are ""carriers"" who then spread the virus to others.

I'm not going to rumor monger and post what he said but I do believe we are on the cusp of a very serious pandemic. If what he said is true, and I have no doubt believing him, we are going to be seriously fucked.

	I question some of the above. Death rates from most flu varieties are 0.1 % (1 in 1000) and that hasn't changed in a long time. Also (unfortunately for older people) the death rate from flu, and also from COVID-19, increases rapidly with age above 60.


	There was one flu epidemic that was much deadlier - the ""Spanish flu"" of 1918-1919. That had one especially scary aspect - the death rate among young and middle-aged adults was as high as among the elderly. That virus had a mutation that caused it to provoke an extreme over-reaction of the immune system in many people (look up ""cytokine storm"") and the immune over-reaction itself was the cause of death. Fortunately that behavior hasn't been seen again in any viral epidemic since then.


	I've read that the worldwide number of deaths from the Spanish flu isn't known because the record-keeping was so poor. Estimates are ""from 17 million to 100 million"". Yikes! That's partly because it occurred at the end of World War I when many governments and nations were on the verge of collapse.


	The reason Spanish flu is called Spanish flu is also interesting. It definitely didn't start in Spain. But most European nations were under wartime censorship and their governments simply suppressed news of the epidemic and deaths. In 1918 Spain was not in the war, and had a relatively free press. When the flu reached Spain from France in November 1918, newspapers there were allowed to carry articles about it.

	That the ratio of deaths to infections confirmed by testing. Testing is very incomplete so the true rate may be lower. But even if the rate is ""only"" 2%, that's 20 times worse than a flu epidemic, which is really bad (flu kills a lot of people).


	Also, some other pre-existing illnesses greatly increase the risk of death. I found the following:


	Death rate from COVID-19, depending on pre-existing condition:


	+ cardiovascular disease: 10.5 %


	+ diabetes: 7.3 %


	+ chronic respiratory (lung) disease: 6.3 %


	+ high blood pressure: 6.0 %


	+ cancer: 5.6 %


	no pre-existing serious illness: 0.9 %

	Banger - I totally agree with you!


	What troubles me is that our democracy is now largely controlled and manipulated by less than 1% of Americans. We have essentially become a plutocracy, and are no longer a democracy. Yes, it's still largely in the American public's hands to ""vote the scoundrels"" out of office, but it's increasingly unlikely that it will happen when public opinion is based on fiction that become facts in our news cycles, and public policy is communicated with 280 characters in a tweet.


	Addressing public health concerns with economic policy is a little f____ed up.

	Besides we were never a democracy (thankfully), we’re a republic.  But every increase in federalism is an increase in the plutocracy. (Is that related to Pluto, Mickey’s sidekick?😁).

	That is just it.  This particular strain has NOT been around before.  The general family of corona virus has been identified and known since the 1960's.  Numerous ""colds"" and ""flu"" have in reality been from relatively harmless corona virus strains and were misdiagnosed as cold or flu.  Then mutations occur (frequent and common in viruses!!) resulting in not so harmless strains.  Remember SARS and MERS?  Both were very aggressively attacked to stop their spread.  SARS had a death to case rate of over 10 percent.  MERS was far worse.  Both were corona viruses. This new strain is a very close relative and most nearly resembles SARS when compared to other coronas.  COVID 19 is NOT the fucking common cold no matter what Rush and the boys are trying to tell everyone.  Meanwhile the guy in the White House who has never seen a science paper or national security service assessment that he believes is only concerned about preserving his main re-election point - the economy (which is a totally false narrative to begin with!!).  So he marches out Ben Carson, md and lunatic in charge of a federal department, this morning to basically say don't worry be happy, sure some old farts with underlying conditions will die, but so what.  Plan for cruise ship docking on west coast tomorrow (quarantine, don't quarantine, keep on ship, allow off, etc.) ....... uh, we haven't formulated one yet!!! Once they do I am sure the plan will be ""beautiful and perfect.""  And his scapegoat in chief Pence can scarcely get a statement out of his mouth before some other admin luminary contradicts him.  Situation normal ...... deny, divert, lie, and confuse.  Wave flags and red caps and brag of all the things done for ""us"" that are just falsehoods.  A very, very sad time in which we live.  And yes, the far left are just as bad or worse.  If you all vote for either ................. aw, hell, never mind,  why change now with such sterling results???

	We may be headed towards a pandemic, but we aren’t there as of today.


	Every few years a strain of flu virus comes through that is a pandemic.


	The last pandemic from a virus was 2009/2010. In that year, the H1N1 killed over 15 million people worldwide. The H1N1 mutated, evolved and infected people at an extremely fast pace. At the time the advice from the medical experts stressed all the normal things we should be doing for preventing the spread of the flu...wash your hands, use hand sanitizer, cover your coughs, stay home if you’re sick. In addition, they stressed to not panic. Events weren’t cancelled, people didn’t empty store shelves in a panic. We all kept our wits about us and reality was maintained. All the same things we are being told to do today.


	The difference between 2009/2010 and 2020 is social media. People are not facing reality and are willing to listen to social media blow this completely out of proportion.


	We as a society need to get a grip and use common sense about the coronavirus.


	Im not saying this isn’t something to be concerned about.


	What I’m saying is remain calm, use common sense and don’t panic. Panicking will not help anything. Use good hygiene practices. Stay home if your sick or exhibiting cold or flu symptoms. Just like you should have done 5 years ago.


	And for fuck sake...quit blaming a political party or a single political person for the coronavirus and spread of mis-information.


	This is not a politically caused situation by Republicans or Democrats.


	This is a medical issue and the medical experts are the best and only source we should be relying on.


	I apologize for this long rant. But I had to get this off my chest.

	Well social media blows everything out of proportion for those foolish enough to believe.  Bigger difference - in this country we had both vaccine for flu with better than 50 percent effectiveness, anti-viral meds with a good degree of effectiveness, and decades of experience doing ""support services"" for those with flu.  literally NONE of that applies to the current topic.  No matter how it is spun or denied, this is not the same thing by any stretch.  With any luck at all the strain will simply run its course and vanish, but depending on luck runs counter to my nature.

			That is just it.  This particular strain has NOT been around before.  The general family of corona virus has been identified and known since the 1960's.  Numerous ""colds"" and ""flu"" have in reality been from relatively harmless corona virus strains and were misdiagnosed as cold or flu.  Then mutations occur (frequent and common in viruses!!) resulting in not so harmless strains.  Remember SARS and MERS?  Both were very aggressively attacked to stop their spread.  SARS had a death to case rate of over 10 percent.  MERS was far worse.  Both were corona viruses. This new strain is a very close relative and most nearly resembles SARS when compared to other coronas.  COVID 19 is NOT the fucking common cold no matter what Rush and the boys are trying to tell everyone.  Meanwhile the guy in the White House who has never seen a science paper or national security service assessment that he believes is only concerned about preserving his main re-election point - the economy (which is a totally false narrative to begin with!!).  So he marches out Ben Carson, md and lunatic in charge of a federal department, this morning to basically say don't worry be happy, sure some old farts with underlying conditions will die, but so what.  Plan for cruise ship docking on west coast tomorrow (quarantine, don't quarantine, keep on ship, allow off, etc.) ....... uh, we haven't formulated one yet!!! Once they do I am sure the plan will be ""beautiful and perfect.""  And his scapegoat in chief Pence can scarcely get a statement out of his mouth before some other admin luminary contradicts him.  Situation normal ...... deny, divert, lie, and confuse.  Wave flags and red caps and brag of all the things done for ""us"" that are just falsehoods.  A very, very sad time in which we live.  And yes, the far left are just as bad or worse.  If you all vote for either ................. aw, hell, never mind,  why change now with such sterling results???

			The last pandemic from a virus was 2009/2010. In that year, the H1N1 killed over 15 million people worldwide.
		



	Sorry, that number 15 million fatalities is totally wrong, way too high. The estimates I found for deaths from the 2009/2010 H1N1 epidemic are 150,000 to 600,000 worldwide and 9,000 to 18,000 in the United States. And about 10 % to 20 % of the entire world population of 6.8 billion caught the H1N1 flu.


	Since 0.68 billion to 1.36 billion people had the illness, and 150,000 to 600,000 died from it, the fatality rate was 0.01% to 0.09 % (or between 1 in 10,000 and 9 in 10,000). The fatality rate of COVID-19 is currently estimated to be 2 %, which is obviously a lot higher.


	However, the 2009/2010 pandemic had one unusual / scary feature (compared to typical flu epidemics) - it killed young people a lot more. About 80% of fatalities were under 65 years old, while for typical flu only 20% of the fatalities are under 65.


	People with high risk from COVID-19 are described as ""older adults"" (over 60), or with existing chronic medical conditions including heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes. Smokers are also at high risk.

	Well, the news agencies are definitely profiting.


	The markets, as they say, are volatile.  But I think the oil price war between OPEC & Russia has as much to do with that.

	Bit, I believe that the media and social media is driving this story very hard.


	When a new flu strain hits, the medical professionals always push real hard to wash our hands, use hand sanitizer, cover our coughs and sneezes and isolate ourselves if we have a fever or feel sick.


	With our current geopolitical climate and the accessibility of the media/social media, the Covid-19 story is in our faces.


	I just read that WHO has now declared this a pandemic even though they admit that this doesn’t really meet the pandemic criteria used in the past.


	I for one will continue living life as I did 2 months ago before this all broke out. I will continue to use common sense regarding this virus just like I have done with colds, flu, pneumonia, bronchitis, etc.


	I’ll continue to travel on business on an as needed basis domestically.  I’ll evaluate each trip to determine if I can handle this from my desk or do I really need to travel. I will eliminate foreign travel (even to Canada and Mexico) for the next month, maybe longer. Again, just using common sense here. I’ll still go to restaurants, drive Uber, maybe go to sporting events, etc. I will still hobby as before. No changes there.


	Now if the people who contract the coronavirus start mutating and turning into zombies, it will definitely be time to reassess my life style. But hobbying will not stop.

	I’d go a slightly different route. We can focus on the media but the pure lack of information starting from the source, China, and its response to it; locking down billions of people, making people disappear, preventing doctors from speaking on it, and whatever other measures they’ve put in place to ensure 0 info gets out including their infection and mortality rates make it a bit more scary than normal. 
	 


	Now if I go the media route and a bit of conspiracy it’s an election year and there’s generally a “major” virus when elections occur. SARS, Avian Flu, Swine Flu, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and now COVID-19. There maybe no correlation but those have all sprung up during election times. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I tend to not go this particular route because it has the potential to undermine an actual threat and people downplay it more then they probably should. 
	 


	If anything this does force people to be way more aware of just how easy it is spread diseases and how little most do to ensure they’re not passing things to others.

	Do you even know what flummery is?  What is your point?  What exactly that I said is in any way in conflict with CDC and WHO information, or is in your opinion, incorrect?  The Spanish Flu is a very interesting historic event but has little to do with COVID-19 and our current challenges - completely different viruses, completely different medical capabilities, and the biggest factor today the open free and common world wide travel and hugely increased modes of an epidemic spreading rapidly.

	Hopefully Dyson doesn't price the ventilators using the same method he uses for his vacuum cleaners and hair styling wands. 


	His hair wands are are $500.00...for something that uses air to style hair.

	This post is nothing but flummery.  Please everyone,  rather than spread misinformation abut this virus, get your facts from the CDC or Johns Hopkins University,  The CDC site is constantly u[dated and they have links to other reputable sites.  JHU worldwide statistics and news that is trustworthy because they have affiliations with hospitals, clinics and universities all over the world.  I also urge everyone while they are sitting at home to  read about the Spanish Flu of 1918 thru early 1920.  While times are certainly different today, there are some parallels.  Then was wartime without the communication we have today.  My grandmother was a nurse during that pandemic and  I still remember some of her stories about people being brought to the hospital and dying within hours.

	Do you even know what flummery is?  What is your point?  What exactly that I said is in any way in conflict with CDC and WHO information, or is in your opinion, incorrect?  The Spanish Flu is a very interesting historic event but has little to do with COVID-19 and our current challenges - completely different viruses, completely different medical capabilities, and the biggest factor today the open free and common world wide travel and hugely increased modes of an epidemic spreading rapidly.

	Hopefully Dyson doesn't price the ventilators using the same method he uses for his vacuum cleaners and hair styling wands. 


	His hair wands are are $500.00...for something that uses air to style hair.

Mild cases of COVID-19 defined::


		“Mild” cases of coronavirus can also be more severe than people imagine, however. Bruce Aylward of the WHO told The New York Times last week that “mild” cases in China were not necessarily like a mild cold.
	



″‘Mild’ was a positive test, fever, cough ― maybe even pneumonia, but not needing oxygen,” he explained. ”‘Severe’ was breathing rate up and oxygen saturation down, so needing oxygen or a ventilator. ""Critical’ was respiratory failure or multi-organ failure.”
	

		_____________________

Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.


	There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.

	After about 7 decades of life as a fine, upright, handsome example of American manhood I have grown accustomed to female attention and the occasional approach by attractive younger ladies. That is my story, anyway, and I will stick to it.


	Yesterday, while walking from the store to my car I was approached in the parking lot by a lovely young woman. She wasted no time at all, asking if I might be interested in trading with her, sex for toilet paper.


	I said ""Maybe. What kind of toilet paper do you have?""

Interested in something else he assured her that he was healthy but she insisted ...no exceptions. The man sighed but agreed. Much to his surprise, he had the most intense experience of his life. Afterwards, he kissed her goodbye and was leaving. He shook his head, turned and asked, "" I'm no rookie but about halfway through you started in with the most incredible heavenly technique the rest of the way ...what  do you call what you were doing?

	I want to make a couple suggestions for everyone here. These suggestions apply to those still hobbying and those not. IF people hobby now is personal choice and is discussed in other threads.  1) I strongly suggest using a neti pot at least a couple time a day. As soon as possible after a session or going out in public for sure. If you get infected, every virus you wash out buys your body time to build antibodies before symptoms set in.  2) I strongly suggest gargling with antiseptic rinse a couple times a day between neti pot uses. The idea is the kill\wash out some viri that may be working their way down towards the bronchial tubes. The idea again is to buy your body time to build antibodies. The hours or days delay could be critical in both lessening symptoms, and decreasing the risk of a dangerous, sudden, over active immune response ( cytokine storm)

			You will notice the article says it will not prevent the spread of covid -19. The idea is to not GET it....not to prevent spreading it after. However, let's not waste time on advice and things when there are jokes to tell. As you helped remind us, if we need medical advice, we only need Business Insider, not TOB. On a more important news note, in response to the economic and sexual hardships imposed on the sex workers and clients, the CDC has begun selling new, crotchless bio hazard suits.

	Making people look silly is what most people try to do when anyone gives any advice on any subject on TOB. Disagreeing without being disagreeable is not really possible for most here...not all, but most. This board is about entertainment . Now, that might be buying ladies time, jokes, enjoying reviews, trolling, making folks look silly, showing off, self promoting, pontificating, posturing, board warrioring, flirting....etc...etc. You are dead right about there being no place for advice like in a real community of people who actually care. I certainly won't  be doing that again. Thank you for your suggestion that I do not post on this subject as It seems well motivated. I shall continue to post on whatever subjects entertain me.

	Definitely understand the mortgage issue so do not understand why you aren't seeing your old buddies who are over 65. From what I have read you are at as much at risk of being infected by any age except kids who are more resistant. All ages can be a carrier but over 65 are more likely to have underlying conditions and a weaker immune system so the are more to likely to get sick and have more serious symptoms. Do think your travel ban is wise.


	If I am wrong or if someone has more current information please correct me!!!!

	While I defer to our many member epidemiologists, I have nowhere seen that age is a factor in prevalence. Simply put, you're as likely to catch it if you're 20 as if you're 80 yrs old. People of all ages can become infected and transmit the virus. Age is a factor in the course of the disease and outcomes. Simply put, if you're over 65 and you do contract the virus, you're more likely to die.  If you're going to continue to see people, your restriction on prior travel makes sense but just barely. The restriction on age is not supported by the data.

	A 20, 30, 40 year old can be just as easily infected as a 60 or 70 year old with this crap. The only difference is that a 50, 60, 70 year old (and anyone with other health conditions) has greater chance of the symptoms being more severe.


	Traveling by commercial carrier is definitely not a good thing right now. My last business trip was 3 weeks ago and I have been checking my temperature daily...it’s always below 98.6.


	No plans in the next month for travel. I can probably conduct most meetings over GoTo Meeting for the next month.

	I've heard it said if, when this whole thing is over,  we think nothing happened, then we were successful in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.


	We need to think about not becoming infected, and also about not infecting others if we are sick.

	No, I don’t think all the infested are self quarantining,  simply because most folks are carriers for several days before they become symptomatic.  The whole point of the social distancing campaign and business closures is to reduce exposure to one another, and thereby reduce the probability of infection.

	While I defer to our many member epidemiologists, I have nowhere seen that age is a factor in prevalence. Simply put, you're as likely to catch it if you're 20 as if you're 80 yrs old. People of all ages can become infected and transmit the virus. Age is a factor in the course of the disease and outcomes. Simply put, if you're over 65 and you do contract the virus, you're more likely to die.  If you're going to continue to see people, your restriction on prior travel makes sense but just barely. The restriction on age is not supported by the data.

	A 20, 30, 40 year old can be just as easily infected as a 60 or 70 year old with this crap. The only difference is that a 50, 60, 70 year old (and anyone with other health conditions) has greater chance of the symptoms being more severe.


	Traveling by commercial carrier is definitely not a good thing right now. My last business trip was 3 weeks ago and I have been checking my temperature daily...it’s always below 98.6.


	No plans in the next month for travel. I can probably conduct most meetings over GoTo Meeting for the next month.


	You have to make a choice of what you feel is right for you during this difficult time period.

	I've heard it said if, when this whole thing is over,  we think nothing happened, then we were successful in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.


	We need to think about not becoming infected, and also about not infecting others if we are sick.


	For the purposes of this board, think of it as a bad, BAD case of the clap.  First off, you don't want to get it, but if you do, isn't the honorable thing NOT to give it to someone else?

	I’m glad you all are finding it courageous and the right thing to do but what about us who depend on it. There isn’t some anonymous donation going around to keep our head above water. I know how healthy I feel and I stay home more than most people so I know I haven’t been around anyone that has it or that has been around someone that has. I don’t think it’s a horrible thing to definitely be more particular with who you see but I don’t have many options. I Spent my whole life being a bartender so I’m not quite sure what  I can do to survive at this poin. It’s scary to think about getting it but being homeless is just as scary so I don’t know what people want us to do. It’s easy for you guys to say no but imagine if you were us... just put yourself in our shoes.  It’s not an easy place to be right now

	It's not an easy place for anybody to be in right now. There are plenty of us who are not providers that have already been laid off and have no means of income. Individuals with no savings and/or credit who are living paycheck to paycheck are going to feel this first and most certainly the hardest.


	What would be most devastating is if the unregulated derivatives markets fail. Then, the BIG BOYS in government would most certainly provide bailouts for the big corporations and investors who have been betting on futures.  Yes, every American will likely get a couple of checks for $1200 bucks, but the amount of money that would go into the pockets of already wealthy speculators will be obscene.


	I think the financial fallout of this pandemic has the potential to make 2008 look like a little blip in the economy.

	I think it's all about lessening the curve of infections, and the exponential growth of transmissions that can happen in larger groups. Ideally, if everyone were able to self isolate, then the health care systems would be about to contain it. But that's a perfect world scenario...

pfunk|https://theotherboard.com/forum/../users/94833/|N/A|03/22/2020  7:59  PM|"

	Containment, and slowing the rate of infection, are the reasons for bars and restaurants shutting down.  It's also why we are social isolating.


	Like the providers, I work for myself. I understand their concerns. I have 6 days of work left (booked before this started), and then zilch/nothing. I'm certain many providers have zilch/nothing right now. Many, many, many people are already laid off with no income. 


	Almost everyone is suffering. All we can do is support each other, as best we can.

	No, I don’t think all the infested are self quarantining,  simply because most folks are carriers for several days before they become symptomatic.  The whole point of the social distancing campaign and business closures is to reduce exposure to one another, and thereby reduce the probability of infection.

			Adding Pictures to the Gallery: 
	#1 Click to Create New Gallery. You have the option to Rename that Gallery.
 


	#2 Then click ADD TO GALLERY  This will open the Media Manager window. (If you added pictures previously, they will be in there)
 


	You will then click and browse your Tablet, Phone or Computer and locate the pictures you want to upload.
 


	#3 Once you have upload the pictures, please CLICK each picture you want to appear in that gallery.
 


	#4 Once you have CLICKED all the pictures you want to appear in that gallery, click the ADD button at the bottom of the Media Manager window.
 


	You have now created a gallery. You can repeat the process for each gallery you want to create.  


	PICTURE WON'T LOAD: 
	Does the blue line load, but then no image appears? If so, the image is to large. A quick fix, send that image to yourself in a text message, save that and then upload that image.

			The PussyCats kept a tight rein on the StrayCats.  They recognized that the M&G were a major marketing event.  If the gals didn‚Äôt mingle with the TomCats, they weren‚Äôt invited to the next event.  They also kept a rein on the TomCats; get out of hand (drunk, grabby, etc) and you got dropped from the group.  These actions made it a safe environment for all.  I often made an appointment with someone new (to me) shortly after one of these events.

			Actually I think the first of the Meet&Greet parties was hosted by RagTop many years ago.  Then Sweet Ashley started the tradition for the TOB crowd.  When Ashley retired, the Pussycats continued the practice.  As I recall mtmoves & Bear also hosted a few.

			Actually everything you stated above is more of the myth. I have interectactions with a lot of providers, maybe 5%-10%  fit into this category. 
 


	However I can see you swimming around in that 5-10% pool because you post craigslist ads in search of providers. So it could seem like most providers are this way to someone like you. 
 


	If clients find themsleves only coming across ladies where this is a constant issue, try setting the bar a little higher. Join the other 90-95% and stop putting down providers and assigning us these dated stereotypes, and take responsibility for your own poor choices.

			Imo deposits should only be given after you've done extensive research on the provider, and come to the conclusion she has a reputation of integrity and doesn't steal from her clients.  Guys getting hundreds of dollars stolen from them are thinking with the wrong head.

			There's absolutely nothing wrong with reaching out to our community while we're in the midde of a pandemic/economic depression. The majority of this country has received assistance for being out of work. There are fundraisers all over helping their communities that have fallen on hard times, and these are hard times.  Heaven forbid one of us reaches out to our own community to help some of our own. You just want to use this tragedy as another opportunity to bash on SWs, because thats what you do.

			Each lady will decide when to come back, if they haven't already, and as always will handle that in their own ways. Many clients have been seeing providers just as they always have. They never really slowed down. Most ladies I personally know will be back on a limited basis at the very least mid to end of May/beginning of June.

			I really appreciate this post. Providers can be so judgmental when it comes to how other providers screen/don't screen. I've experienced this and I screen, just not the same way as they do. I find it arrogant and ignorant, especially because these same ladies have the most issues with their clients, and are constanly compaining how shitty they are, and really bad horror stories. The proof is in the pudding. If you have 95% great experiences with clients or even even in your dealings potential clients you never see, you're doing something right. I wouldn't trade that for those who require much more screening and 50% of the clients they deal with are not good. 
 


	I just want to add...Danni, you gave me a reference for a gentleman awhile back who Is one of my favorite clients to see, and he's also been the most supportive in helping the ladies getting through these hard times and he's become a wonderful addition to our community.

			What‚Äôs funny is for some providers, it doesn‚Äôt deter biz at all. Infamy can draw a lot of attraction... Plenty of clients just don‚Äôt post reviews that often.

			A few reasons why I‚Äôve rejected potentials: they didn‚Äôt take the time to read my ad or website and want me to provide a menu, they told me after reaching out to their refs that they found someone else/aka they wasted a lot of my time so I will never see them even if they reach out again, they were annoying or rude, sent me ???? when I don‚Äôt respond within two minutes, the refs they provided had sketchy reviews, the ref they thought would give them a good ref actually let me know they don‚Äôt wash their ass, the ref they sent me is someone I‚Äôd never reach out to, the ref they sent is someone I‚Äôd rather not share clientele with, etc. Your refs aren‚Äôt always gonna tell you what they share with another provider, so if they didn‚Äôt enjoy having you over, they‚Äôre gonna reflect that in their reference. This solidarity with providers keeps us safe. And hell, maybe-just maybe, a provider doesn‚Äôt want to share you bc you‚Äôre that special. Just tell yourself the last one if you‚Äôre stressed about it. Or do other forms of screening.

			I was talking about OP. I still don‚Äôt think you can compare them.

			No worries, I can put it into simpler terms for you: paid content isn‚Äôt for people like you. You say compensating creators is a waste. So the small fee we charge is to keep people like you away from our content.  
	 
 


	Banger, in the capitalistic market, non-essential goods/services like this can‚Äôt really be compared to another. Just as we‚Äôve all discussed in rate threads, it all depends on the provider and their needs.   
	I could spend $5 at Taco Bell(I‚Äôm a cheap date) or $10 at a similar establishment. Maybe I just have a preference but I‚Äôm not going to say spending that money is a waste. Supporting people is not a waste. That‚Äôs the operative word here, and it‚Äôs very rude. Just say you don‚Äôt care to buy content and move on, you don‚Äôt need to insult a whole industry of people.

			Exactly why a lot of content creators have a small fee like $10, to keep away from people who would never support you where it matters. They‚Äôd probably rather rip them off and find free content- which someone worked hard to make. It‚Äôs good to know that people who dehumanize creators and think supporting us is a waste won‚Äôt get to see our content for free. Unless you‚Äôre the scum of the earth and participate in pirating/distributing content you don‚Äôt own. 
	 
 


	Which is another reason creators have more content for purchase that isn‚Äôt on their page, because $10/mo is a very nice donation, but it isn‚Äôt worth having ALL your content leaked by subhumans. I also follow pretty famous stars on OF and they do exactly the same thing- probably because they‚Äôre tired of being ripped off.

			There always seems to be a question about girls asking for a deposit. Here‚Äôs the deal, unfortunately there seems to be an abundance of friends asking for outcalls , which a lot of providers don‚Äôt mind doing but here‚Äôs the problem. You get all dolled up you drive to the location that was requested, you get there and nobody answers their phone or it‚Äôs an address that‚Äôs bogus !!This never used to happen but in the last few years we‚Äôve got a much younger crowd who seem to think that it‚Äôs kind of funny to mess with somebodys time!!!In. In saying this there are far more who do not do that. So . Some Seem to think that they‚Äôre going to be shaded by giving somebody a deposit. So let me break this down... number one - provider has a reputation to keep and there are reviews that can be written so if somebody gets shaded the Friend has the option to write a review stating what happened and therefore the provider loses good reputation So the chances of our friends getting shaded are pretty slim. Does it happen, absolutely but far less than what happens on our side.
 


	so Let‚Äôs assume we don‚Äôt get a deposit and we show up and it‚Äôs a bogus appointment. We don‚Äôt know who set that up we don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs where we should be we don‚Äôt know what the circumstances are all we know is that we‚Äôre shaded  with no recourse., so if you think about it logically if a provider asks for a deposit and you‚Äôre serious about spending time, then there should be no issues. I‚Äôm sorry that there are situations that some of our friends have gone through where they get shaded or ripped off,  just remember you have the option to write a review!! So please stop thinking that deposits are a bad thing they are not. Put yourself in a provider shoes just for a moment and try to understand we‚Äôre all trying to Have fun with no glitches.

			My sympathies go out to anybody who has lost a loved one under any circumstance. And although we have lost all those people that you mention up there in different situations it‚Äôs the fact that we‚Äôre losing so many people so fast losing 80,000 people over a years time is not like losing 5000 in 6weeks.  it just keeps doubling, rolling down the hill faster if you will. Let‚Äôs hope that this might just be what the country needed ? things have been going so fast  and i feel like The saying stopping to smell the roses has become just that ...just a saying ! nobody really does it anymore I mean it sucks what  we‚Äôre going through, totally !!! but it‚Äôs also kind of nice to pull back on life and reflect and realize how good we have it. This shit is scary and horrible . But maybe mother nature  is weeding herself out?  Slapping us in the face , waking us up and making us remember whats important in life. The world made it through worse things im suspecting the world will get through this too. Now go wash your hands

			I +1 this !! Its insane how appts are made and ncns!!  But as for op did you do your homework? I mean i dont do an extensive check like that... i have my own screening process i use. And if im unsure of someones intentions , i.e. they book multiple hours ... i may or may not ask for half deposit as well . I do ask for dep. on outcalls , just for the reason of too many bogus appts. I chalk that up to the fact that their are younger players in the game and a lot of them , not all ,  but some tend to think its cute to mess w providers. Thats my own opinion  but im not sure i agree all red flags on this one jmo

			A-fucking-men!!!
 


	My response to those ""hey I've got to have protection, too"" self absorbed, entitled assholes usually goes a little something like this:
 


	""Lol @  the mention of I've got to have protection, ""TOO"". This implies that I've got any sort of protection or reassurance from YOU, which, seeing as how you're contacting me from a Text App (as is too often the case, despite my CLEARLY unmistakeably stated instructions to contact me otherwise), I have absolutely no clue who you could be, Mr. John Doe.
 


	A well established provider on a reputable site (that you yourself chose, in fact, to find me in the first place)
 


	You? You could be anybody. And I'm thinking you're looking like you've got something to hide. I'm not in this to seek out your family and destroy your life, that just wouldn't be smart for me business -wise now would it? And if you're expecting me to let you in MY space with your ol' secretive ass, well...... Think again, buster.""
 


	The ones who are actually legit get it and start sending what is needed ASAP. The fake timewaster imposter ones, usually = crickets....
 


	Until the NEXT time they decide to try to break thru my screening again, which is sometimes an hour from new number, sometimes 15min, sometimes the next day, or sometimes not for a few days. But yes gents, the struggle to stay safe in this IS SO REAL, so be real or get gone. Please. Thanks in advance !!!

	I LOVE TOB & have been utilizing this wonderful site for almost a year now. I love passing time reading posts, but have never posted anything myself..... That is, until now! 
 


	I feel like it's my obligation to help educate those interested in proper etiquette (which really ought to be ALL of you), as well as for the ladies, so that they may have this to send to those who violate these expectations without having to really say anything

			OP....It's really not that difficult.
 


	Choose an established provider who is newbie friendly (many of us can guide you through gently) ...expect some RW info needed (this is where it differs in How we verify that RW info..... and everyone has their own methods...IMO  it's so easy to do so nowadays electronically (unless you cloak yourself up TOO much.)..and sometimes..ID is not even needed- (I haven't had to use a screen print of any ID except for 1/2X in my career).
 


	Most importantly remember.... Us ladies do not want to ""ruin a life""....we simply want to not get killed , hurt or incarcerated... 
 


	The biggest drama and horror stories that you hear out there are often the ones that are fly by night providers who do not screen...which is usually due to some drama that yields even more drama down the line... best to avoid that.

			""Newbie"" = someone who has not seen another companion.... particularly for ladies who rely on references for a major element of screening. Seeing someone who is brand new involves a bit of coaching... and also risk in trying to determine if their expectations are on par with what this venture really is... I've had guys who have seen companions in the past and didn't have recent references and claim that they are ""newbie again"" ..nope...not how it works.  Seeing newbies can be a big risk in safety and comfort...and those companions...that do...typically have some different protocols to navigate it for both...

			What has been the best and worst experiences for all of us that have to stay home for work? 
 


	Some best has been: 1. cleaning the entire condo like never before
 


	                                      2. pulling out my violin and actually playing it! :-)
 


	                                      3 taking more time to reach out to friends and family on the phone 
 


	Worst has been :    Missing my gym buddies ( although been working out daily ;-))
 


	                                  Getting a nice massage!
 


	                                  Missing the rush hour traffic on Leedsdale  ( jk just seeing if y'all are actually reading this! )
 


	Feel free to share or vent! If you are struggling we are here for you !

			Hi Laci,
 


	I just wanted to thank you for this post. I spent a significant amount of time with this wonderful lady yesterday and we both agree that we are on the verge of a beautiful friendship and that neither of us need to fuck up our personal lives. We are seeing each other regularly but we are having a ton of fun (like we are both 18 again) and just enjoying the moment. It made me think of your posts, so I just wanted to say thanks.

			Laci, Sorry meant no disrespect. I think ladies like yourself are the gems on here and that is clear by your reviews, your posts and the respect the guys show you here.
 


	pfunk it was meant to be satirical. clearly I need to work on my delivery.
 


	ilovewomen, I would say my experience so far has been about 85-90% positive. The biggest reason its not higher is because of the false narrative that I think is standard for this industry. Outdated pictures, over exaggerating of age, false measurements or outdated ones. Which may seem small to others but that's the reason I even reach out to these wonderful women in the first place. Every lady that I have seen that had accurate info and up to date pictures and info would get a 100% from me! Even if we didn't ""click"".
 


	Question to you all... So if I if I posted a honest review of a experienced TOB lady that had a glowing report from all the seasoned vet's and I said I would not reccomend her because she was clearly not into it and it felt like she was just going through the motions, that her pics were very dated and she was clearly older than she says she is. I would get called out and even attacked by the lady with zero defense for myself and because I am a newbie would get downplayed by the seasoned guys. True or False?
 


	Because I have had that experience. So instead of posting the truth I said nothing until this post.

			Thank you Lacy, even though i don‚Äôt think it was your intention to prove my point. There has only been 18 - no or s so reviews this year out of 1016 reviews done this year (yes I‚Äôm that kind or dork). So by that static alone only 1% of us are not happy with the services provided?
 


	So just as a unit of measure (in no means am I comparing what you ladies do to selling chicken) Chic-Fil-A has an 86% customer satisfaction percentage and is by far and away the best rated in the fast food industry. Still doesn‚Äôt even come close to the 99% approval ratings here.   
	Just to be clear I am not comparing your sexy bodies to their delicious spicy chicken deluxe sandwich but all I‚Äôm saying that the inherent nature is that both providers as well as clients could NEVER have that high of an approval rating. Everyone has bad days or bad vibes or things just didn‚Äôt click. The culture has created a group of story tellers rather than honest opinion about their experience.
 


	And to be 100% honest I don‚Äôt care what acronym position you got into or that you both had ‚Äúglorious simultaneous organisms‚Äù. *cough*bullshirt*cough. Just tell me that you had a good time, the gal is who she says she is, her pics are maybe dated but overall accurate and that you would or would not choose to see her again. Let‚Äôs leave the fiction writing to Stephen King.
 


	just my 2 cents... -J

			I wish I could say that was 100% accurate. For a few reasons...
 


	1) Too many guys making posts about their sexual conquests, ie. story telling and not truth telling.
 


	2) If/When someone makes a ""NO"" or ""SO-SO"" review they get berated how it was the client who was the creep and not the girl then the guy gets blacklisted by ladies. So whats the truth here? Is the client a scumbag or is the provider not who the reviews say they are. Or was it just a YMMV? 
 


	3) Many people (like myself) who don't want to participate in the reviews because of the above two items mentioned. I have made two reviews, one here and one on private delights. The one on here (TY Maggie you are awesome!) was to help with my profile so I can see other ladies and the other was because the provider asked me too. And she was great so I did.
 


	So for example I saw someone a while ago that has a sterling reputation on TOB. Listed as all natural, listed at a certain age, etc. For me it was clearly a YMMV and the she was significantly older with some serious work done. I don't care if you have had work done or what your age is. I just want to see the person who is being reviewed and advertised. I don't know how the reviews used to work but to me they feel more like a sexual conquest story board rather than the truth.
 


	I think all Prayforrian is trying to say is that it would be nice to have a message board or private discussion for the clients to have without providers insight regarding ladies who are out for more than just sexual encounter. What ever that may be good, bad or indifferent.

			Shyguy,
 


	I appreciated your post regardless of what else was said here. We are all human and all susceptible to our emotions. This is why I posted the question here in the first place. Yes I knew I would get criticism and but I hoped that someone or someones could provide insight to my experience. The cynic in me did not believe an actual connection could be made and that I was paying for a service. An Amazing Service (THANK YOU LADIES) but a service non the less. So when I started thinking that we actually made a deeper connection I had to ask the community. If it is the once in 35 year connection or maybe its just a moment in time that we both hopefully enjoy while it lasts. We only grow with knowledge and our experiences and I'm not sure where this experience will take me but I can promise that hearing your story and everyone else's reply will help me keep my eyes open and my ears listening. Because at the end of the day I am not going to jeopardize everything I have worked for in my life for one person to come in a wreck it. And I'm sure the gorgeous lady I am referring to doesn't want the same either.
 


	So thank you for your post!

			Don't get me wrong I'm not looking at it like that but it truly took me by surprise.
 


	I've meet some amazing ladies so far and had some amazing experiences but this was something different. Cant even describe it, but unlike my previous encounters it just felt deeper,.  And yes I know a great provider will do that.

	A girl who is a member, asked for and received a $100 deposit from another member.  Then ghosted the guy at the time of the appointment. He posted a warning of her, after waiting a bit.  He wanted  to see if she would contact him back. Only then,  did she post to the thread. Said she would get the money back to him when she had it. Then posted in another thread by mistake that she was in Oklahoma City. Ready to meet some friends. I am sure she spent over $100 to get there and get a room but couldn't refund the money she took from the other member.  I have never and will never advance funds in the hobby. Writing a bad review on the girl doesn't matter. She doesn't care. Otherwise she would never stole the deposit.

			Basically I kind of know how you feel. I got on P411 to see one girl in particular. She was a dancer at a club but I never had a chance to get any dances. She had a lot of regulars.  As soon as I became a member, she went dark. She reappeared 6 months later but never got back with my appointment request. I know she looked at my profile several times. Then went inactive. That's life.
 


	Like Stevie-2249 said, they get a lot of calls. I was good friends with one girl. We would get a bite now and then. Hangout and drink. Her phone would go off at all hours. You wouldn't believe how many calls she would get at 3am. I don't know why this one lied about the reason she wouldn't meet. They can't do everyone that calls them. Maybe that was the excuse she used to control volume. Hoping you might call her another day.

			Yes they can be cheaper per hour, but the couple I had always try to guilt you into helping them. It's my kids birthday and I need some money for presents, my car broke down and I can't pay the mechanic, my electricity got shut off and now my alarm won't work,  I have had the flu and couldn't work. Could you give me a couple hundred for groceries. My dog is sick and I can't afford the vet. These were actual requests from a number of girls. Some I did give funds because they were long term. Never to a short term girl. As for them making it up to me, well it never happened. Because they are always broke and were needing their regular payment. So now if they ask for funds, I tell them they would have to make an appointment.

			I have done this. There are a lot of girls on this site. It takes a good amount of time to find a good one. Some have pretty high expectations of their worth. Some are just utr providers. Some only want platonic. Some only want online. Then once in a while you find the girl,  who fits your desires.  Keep in mind that if all you want is to bang them a few times a month, you most likely will spend more than a provider most of the time. SA membership is $90 a month. Since some may be new to this, what you get may not be what you want. You have to chat with them a bit over a period of time, if they just are starting out. Pros are they offer more time than a regular provider. Cons are they try to hit you up for allowances or other pre-paid expenses. When you say no, they move on.

			I would travel, while I am still able to enjoy it at first.  Have a lady or two to accompany me. Like Badboy said, land is a lot of work. Still you could have a piece with a caretaker,  that you could visit. Maybe the care taker is a hot chick, who hires out the work. You come to visit her.
 


	Once I got that out of my system, I would help out my family members. Give out scholarships to those in school. Just don't let them know it was from me. Set up some way to give them some funds, but anonymously.  Like hire a lawyer to tell them they were tracked down in probate. A long lost fifth cousin left money and they get a piece. Just make it believable and never let on I won the money.
 


	Then give out some to charities. But not just hand out money. Ask what they need the most and get it to them. In real life I do that. I would like to know my time or money went to something. Too many stories of charities wasting funds on high salaries or lavish officies/cars.

			I agree that things should be kept as mutual beneficial to both as possible. I know there are guys out there that will hound or basically harass a girl. If they spent this energy into finding another girl, then things would be that much better in the hobby.
 


	Then their are the girls who will use the hobby, to go beyond the pay for play scenario. I am not talking about being friends. There is nothing wrong with that. A few might even get into a real relationship. Again nothing wrong with that. What I am talking about are the ones who will try to use us guys. Like I can't cover my bills this month, could you help me out this once. I am stuck and can't afford an Uber. The  mechanic needs a couple hundred to fix my car, I will make it back up to you. It always starts off very small.  Like I am stuck, could you give me a lift. Next thing you know,  you are pushing the cart behind them in the store . Wondering how you got in so deep, with nothing back in return.

Tell her up front that you need to be able to get a reference from her, to build up your credentials. We all have to start somewhere. Most girls understand this. Read the reviews to look for one. This girl may not be exactly what you are looking for,  but it gets your foot in the door. She might also have a friend who will do the same for you. Then you have two references , with which you can use to see a girl you wanted to see to begin with.

			I realize that we're in a pandemic, and that everyone is scrambling to make it work, but it seems to me that the presence of ladies on TOB is really sparse lately. I'm not just talking about active listings, but more about the members who contribute to the boards.
 


	I mean, I just counted 9 females logged  into the system out of 300 on line users.... Granted, some of the ""guests"" could be female, but still - it looks like a ghost town in terms of the female persuasion.
 


	Has TOB served it's purpose since it's inception 10 or twelve years ago? Are there other ""Otherboards"" that people are migrating to that I'm not aware of?  Someplace that isn't a cam site, OnlyFans or similar paysite?

			Nah - she's just someone I could quote - I always try to follow the proper academic principle of quoting reliable sources. Ms Winfrey seems to have earned her place as a revered public persona, and GOD is harder to quote.

			First ever meet and greet I ever attended was in the late 1970s,hosted by a lady that had an ad in the Oyster. All the girls circulated with the men ,just like the Pussycat partys.Wasn't aware of those hosted by RagTop, mtmoves,Bear and Sweet Ashley.  Last meet and greet party I went to was in San Francisco a few years ago.Sadly,the ladies were more interested in getting drunk and talking to each other instead of the guys. It was easy to observe that the potential clients felt neglected and slowly drifted out.

			With my research on decriminalizing sex work I have run across this insane legislation presented by Senators Lindsey Graham (R) and Richard Blumenthatl (D). In May there will be a hearing on the EARN IT act. the legislation would open a door to online-content screening by a governmental commission serving under U.S. Attorney General William Barr. The bill is to target online child sexual-abuse material and trafficking.       But this bill is an attempt to mandate encryption backdoors. This means ending encryption and platforms that don‚Äôt divulge and relinquish user content and personal information and those platforms will be punished. Platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Signal, WeChat, etc. will now be opened up at the government‚Äôs discretion. This has frightening consequences to not only sex workers but the entire internet community. This act will allow government to spy on nearly every aspect of American lives on a massive scale. I‚Äôll stop here as it is a bit complicated but google the ‚ÄúEARN IT act‚Äù for more information. It goes to vote in May, I am not one to write my representative, but I definitely will call in my objection to this bill. It is VERY important.

			Laci and Growl, I agree.  If someone is as they represented themselves to be, but it still wasn't my cup of tea, then that's not a bad or so-so review.  I chalk that up to life - not everyone clicks.  Most, I've found on here, actually DO click and that's great.  I have yet to have a bad experience from a TOB lady, and honestly, there are many on here I think are the bomb.   
	I've had a couple of standups last minute, but if it's someone I've seen, I give the benefit of the doubt.  I've had to change a few appointments myself due to work/travel.  Honesty is what matters.  Research matters just as much.

			Honestly, if I'm asked to download an app for GPS tracking of my movement, I'm fine with it, if it helps do contact tracing as the world starts to open back up.  It can be turned off, temporarily, as well.    
	This will be an important tool to help us trace and contact people who are exposed to known cases.  That's my take - the phone companies and 3rd parties already know tons about me, so it's not that big of deal to me.  Then again, I'm in healthcare, and I see the benefit.  Most people would faint if they knew just how much of our info is already out there, anyway.  If I need to pop offline for an hour, I can turn my phone off.

			Einstein's theory is that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light relatively speaking; a BJ  is directly proportionate to the vacuum it produces at the speed of light would hold true, because space itself is stretching, and space is nothing. we know that the faster you go, the slower time passes, so a 15 minute BJ at the speed of light would be the equivalent to 205 years back on earth.....
 


	 


	Or---> at the speed of light you could go around the world 7.5 times in a second.  around the world could then be an orally stimulating adventure. 
	Also remember when an object moves at the speed of light, its mass will become infinite.

			Who was ""first"" to cross over is an interesting topic - how many white folks followed the R&B billboard charts?  Momma Thornton, Howling Wolf, Chuck Berry were having widening success well before Little Richard's Tutti Frutti in 1955 (same year as Berry's Maybellene)  Yes, I was well aware of the meaning of tuuti frutti.  He was NOT by any means the only early 50's artist to use double entendre lyrics.  As to the gay thing, it never once mattered to me in the slightest throughout all the years of enjoying the hell out of his music.  It is his music that made him a unique legend in my mind ....... and not sure how calling a ""unique legend"" could be an understatement  lol.  He had a huge influence - along with others already mentioned, and a few others - on what became rock and roll.  He and the others opened the door that Elvis blew through and into history.  And one hell of a musician and singer!

			You are welcome.  The search function aint what it used to be but you can still really narrow down the basics at least.  There is a very similar search over under listings, but that one too got dumbed down after SESTA/FOSTA and understandably so.  Unfortunately QV is not a searchable term even by any cheat I tried.   Most ladies seem willing to go at least as short as half hour and usually the QV $ are not much different.  Lastly, it is, in my opinion, folly to recommend specific ladies because my tastes (even simple utf) are likely different from yours, so I don't. Not to mention the rest of the tale ..... heavy, slender, tall, short ..... no idea what you like and since all that is searchable, no need to guess.  And assuming you are talking Denver, I know next to squat about Denver ladies.  Good luck though, the search/hunt is half the fun!  Best I got unless you want to give me a list of ladies you are interested in, pay their hour donation and I will happily do field recon for you and report back!

			If only there were a search function under the reviews section to allow one to find what they seek.  Oh wait ......... there is!!!!

			Late to game but a couple things for OP.  The best source is to pm the members that have reviewed the lady of your yearnings (regardless of whether good or bad review) and ask if there is any additional information they may be willing to share.  this of course works much better if you are known and generally respected and have not pissed off everyone but the pope and he has it under advisement.
 


	 There are of course fake reviews, overly complimentary reviews, occasional revenge bullshit bad review, lying rebuttals and on and on.  Why?  Because both clients and providers are human beings, which means a certain percentage of both are dirty low down, lying, despicable assholes out to figuratively screw whoever they can.  That is life and the world and so of course there are some bad actors here.  But they usually show themselves in posts or reviews or back channel via pm.
 


	Trying to apply random number/function thinking to the number of positive reviews ignores the fact that some of us do extensive research before seeing a new lady including back channel and that heavily skews the results toward a positive experience and review.  If you do it right anyway!!

			Spanking is something you need to ask if it is allowed..  Some love it, and others will not allow it ... A handprint on my ass will not be welcomed..... Just ask!!!

			I wasn't going to reply to this initially..But here I go.Most men on here are looking to get sex for the least possible price.That's why you get all of the negative ""hey baby are you offering a Covid 19 discount. Are you available now? Means that they are not thinking ahead and are most likely married and have a very limited time to see someone else. Offering something that was never offered before this stupid virus is too creepy to me. Everyone please take the time to protect yourselves.
 


	Proper screening is a must! Don't feel like you're asking too much for a temperature reading  or any other screening you might think will make you safe
 


	Rant over.....

			Cliff note version: blah blah blah I, 2Big happen to swear, and whether you know it or nor I'm a Moderator on here set to apply just enough hate to get everyone to respond and keep thing interesting to the point where people drop off because they don't like my kind of hatred. I'm a hater and the only reason why I can possibly still be here is because I have a ""hall pass"" from the mods, or I happen to be a  mod myself.

			The Safeway in the Roxborough area regularly has TP and paper towels. I've seen 20 or so units of each regularly.
 


	Out and about in the germy new world I have discovered if you get out and about early you can find most necessities except bleach, Lysol spray and Clorox wipes.
 


	I've also had GREAT luck at Target's website for paper products and a lot of cleaning supplies. At the door pick up with them is more than helpful!
 


	Hope this helps!

			Aw, puppies are the best. I've raised 4 of them so far. Always had dogs in my life, couldn't think of not having one ever!  Umm..when they eat something like pillows or shoes I always told myself ""it's a good thing they are so damn cute!"" We love Cane Corso (Italian Mastiff) so loyal to friends and family. We spent an entire year socializing our current hound, took (and still take) him everywhere, there's never a situation we come across that I don't trust him 100%
 


	Have fun with your new pup!

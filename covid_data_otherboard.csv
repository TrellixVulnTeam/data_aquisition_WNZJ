	So far, Covid19 has killed about 3,000 globally. Certainly, more people will die — mostly the aged and those with compromised immune systems. For perspective,  80,000 Americans died last year from plain old influenza, according to the Centers for Disease Control.


	Cars kill 36,000 people every year. And yet, we still drive on I25 or I70 in search of love or pussy. And that’s some dangerous action, right there. We all balance risk and reward according to what we want.


	Apart from a few seniors and hypochondriacs, I’m not sure there’ll be a big hit to the hobby. I could be wrong. But I also remember the SARS hysteria, and while that was a big deal in Asia, in Colorado...not so much. At all.


	Just be sure to wash your hands properly and stay healthy.

	Here is another bit of perspective from under-reported illness. Indeed  between 250,000 and 500,000 people die annually from influenza. 10 million people a year are diagnosed with Tuberculosis...and one and a half million of them die.

	SARS: total of 8,000 cases and 800 deaths over entire course of the epidemic (high mortality rate, but didn't spread much).


	COVID-19: total of 87,000 cases total (mostly in China), 2,979 deaths (mostly in China), and 7,155 cases outside China, SO FAR.


	COVID-19 looks like the more serious problem from information we have to date.


	One thing that may actually make COVID-19 worse than SARS - as an epidemic - is that the large majority of people with the illness show only mild symptoms. But they are ""carriers"" who then spread the virus to others.

	I travel to China on business and looking my travel records Ive been over there 22 times in the last 4 years so I have some reliable contacts. Today, I finally heard from someone I know over there and I'll tell you up until his text, I was going to be cognizant and careful. However, I'll  be honest, I am scared shitless about this now. I'm not going to rumor monger and post what he said but I do believe we are on the cusp of a very serious pandemic. If what he said is true, and I have no doubt believing him, we are going to be seriously fucked. 


	I do not trust the Chinese government at all and we had better get really serious in this country about containment.

	I question some of the above. Death rates from most flu varieties are 0.1 % (1 in 1000) and that hasn't changed in a long time. Also (unfortunately for older people) the death rate from flu, and also from COVID-19, increases rapidly with age above 60.


	There was one flu epidemic that was much deadlier - the ""Spanish flu"" of 1918-1919. That had one especially scary aspect - the death rate among young and middle-aged adults was as high as among the elderly. That virus had a mutation that caused it to provoke an extreme over-reaction of the immune system in many people (look up ""cytokine storm"") and the immune over-reaction itself was the cause of death. Fortunately that behavior hasn't been seen again in any viral epidemic since then.


	I've read that the worldwide number of deaths from the Spanish flu isn't known because the record-keeping was so poor. Estimates are ""from 17 million to 100 million"". Yikes! That's partly because it occurred at the end of World War I when many governments and nations were on the verge of collapse.


	The reason Spanish flu is called Spanish flu is also interesting. It definitely didn't start in Spain. But most European nations were under wartime censorship and their governments simply suppressed news of the epidemic and deaths. In 1918 Spain was not in the war, and had a relatively free press. When the flu reached Spain from France in November 1918, newspapers there were allowed to carry articles about it.

	That the ratio of deaths to infections confirmed by testing. Testing is very incomplete so the true rate may be lower. But even if the rate is ""only"" 2%, that's 20 times worse than a flu epidemic, which is really bad (flu kills a lot of people).


	Also, some other pre-existing illnesses greatly increase the risk of death. I found the following:


	Death rate from COVID-19, depending on pre-existing condition:


	+ cardiovascular disease: 10.5 %


	+ diabetes: 7.3 %


	+ chronic respiratory (lung) disease: 6.3 %


	+ high blood pressure: 6.0 %


	+ cancer: 5.6 %


	no pre-existing serious illness: 0.9 %

	Banger - I totally agree with you!


	What troubles me is that our democracy is now largely controlled and manipulated by less than 1% of Americans. We have essentially become a plutocracy, and are no longer a democracy. Yes, it's still largely in the American public's hands to ""vote the scoundrels"" out of office, but it's increasingly unlikely that it will happen when public opinion is based on fiction that become facts in our news cycles, and public policy is communicated with 280 characters in a tweet.


	Addressing public health concerns with economic policy is a little f____ed up.

	Besides we were never a democracy (thankfully), we’re a republic.  But every increase in federalism is an increase in the plutocracy. (Is that related to Pluto, Mickey’s sidekick?😁).

	That is just it.  This particular strain has NOT been around before.  The general family of corona virus has been identified and known since the 1960's.  Numerous ""colds"" and ""flu"" have in reality been from relatively harmless corona virus strains and were misdiagnosed as cold or flu.  Then mutations occur (frequent and common in viruses!!) resulting in not so harmless strains.  Remember SARS and MERS?  Both were very aggressively attacked to stop their spread.  SARS had a death to case rate of over 10 percent.  MERS was far worse.  Both were corona viruses. This new strain is a very close relative and most nearly resembles SARS when compared to other coronas.  COVID 19 is NOT the fucking common cold no matter what Rush and the boys are trying to tell everyone.  Meanwhile the guy in the White House who has never seen a science paper or national security service assessment that he believes is only concerned about preserving his main re-election point - the economy (which is a totally false narrative to begin with!!).  So he marches out Ben Carson, md and lunatic in charge of a federal department, this morning to basically say don't worry be happy, sure some old farts with underlying conditions will die, but so what.  Plan for cruise ship docking on west coast tomorrow (quarantine, don't quarantine, keep on ship, allow off, etc.) ....... uh, we haven't formulated one yet!!! Once they do I am sure the plan will be ""beautiful and perfect.""  And his scapegoat in chief Pence can scarcely get a statement out of his mouth before some other admin luminary contradicts him.  Situation normal ...... deny, divert, lie, and confuse.  Wave flags and red caps and brag of all the things done for ""us"" that are just falsehoods.  A very, very sad time in which we live.  And yes, the far left are just as bad or worse.  If you all vote for either ................. aw, hell, never mind,  why change now with such sterling results???

	We may be headed towards a pandemic, but we aren’t there as of today.


	Every few years a strain of flu virus comes through that is a pandemic.


	The last pandemic from a virus was 2009/2010. In that year, the H1N1 killed over 15 million people worldwide. The H1N1 mutated, evolved and infected people at an extremely fast pace. At the time the advice from the medical experts stressed all the normal things we should be doing for preventing the spread of the flu...wash your hands, use hand sanitizer, cover your coughs, stay home if you’re sick. In addition, they stressed to not panic. Events weren’t cancelled, people didn’t empty store shelves in a panic. We all kept our wits about us and reality was maintained. All the same things we are being told to do today.


	The difference between 2009/2010 and 2020 is social media. People are not facing reality and are willing to listen to social media blow this completely out of proportion.


	We as a society need to get a grip and use common sense about the coronavirus.


	Im not saying this isn’t something to be concerned about.


	What I’m saying is remain calm, use common sense and don’t panic. Panicking will not help anything. Use good hygiene practices. Stay home if your sick or exhibiting cold or flu symptoms. Just like you should have done 5 years ago.


	And for fuck sake...quit blaming a political party or a single political person for the coronavirus and spread of mis-information.


	This is not a politically caused situation by Republicans or Democrats.


	This is a medical issue and the medical experts are the best and only source we should be relying on.


	I apologize for this long rant. But I had to get this off my chest.

	Well social media blows everything out of proportion for those foolish enough to believe.  Bigger difference - in this country we had both vaccine for flu with better than 50 percent effectiveness, anti-viral meds with a good degree of effectiveness, and decades of experience doing ""support services"" for those with flu.  literally NONE of that applies to the current topic.  No matter how it is spun or denied, this is not the same thing by any stretch.  With any luck at all the strain will simply run its course and vanish, but depending on luck runs counter to my nature.

			That is just it.  This particular strain has NOT been around before.  The general family of corona virus has been identified and known since the 1960's.  Numerous ""colds"" and ""flu"" have in reality been from relatively harmless corona virus strains and were misdiagnosed as cold or flu.  Then mutations occur (frequent and common in viruses!!) resulting in not so harmless strains.  Remember SARS and MERS?  Both were very aggressively attacked to stop their spread.  SARS had a death to case rate of over 10 percent.  MERS was far worse.  Both were corona viruses. This new strain is a very close relative and most nearly resembles SARS when compared to other coronas.  COVID 19 is NOT the fucking common cold no matter what Rush and the boys are trying to tell everyone.  Meanwhile the guy in the White House who has never seen a science paper or national security service assessment that he believes is only concerned about preserving his main re-election point - the economy (which is a totally false narrative to begin with!!).  So he marches out Ben Carson, md and lunatic in charge of a federal department, this morning to basically say don't worry be happy, sure some old farts with underlying conditions will die, but so what.  Plan for cruise ship docking on west coast tomorrow (quarantine, don't quarantine, keep on ship, allow off, etc.) ....... uh, we haven't formulated one yet!!! Once they do I am sure the plan will be ""beautiful and perfect.""  And his scapegoat in chief Pence can scarcely get a statement out of his mouth before some other admin luminary contradicts him.  Situation normal ...... deny, divert, lie, and confuse.  Wave flags and red caps and brag of all the things done for ""us"" that are just falsehoods.  A very, very sad time in which we live.  And yes, the far left are just as bad or worse.  If you all vote for either ................. aw, hell, never mind,  why change now with such sterling results???

			The last pandemic from a virus was 2009/2010. In that year, the H1N1 killed over 15 million people worldwide.
		



	Sorry, that number 15 million fatalities is totally wrong, way too high. The estimates I found for deaths from the 2009/2010 H1N1 epidemic are 150,000 to 600,000 worldwide and 9,000 to 18,000 in the United States. And about 10 % to 20 % of the entire world population of 6.8 billion caught the H1N1 flu.


	Since 0.68 billion to 1.36 billion people had the illness, and 150,000 to 600,000 died from it, the fatality rate was 0.01% to 0.09 % (or between 1 in 10,000 and 9 in 10,000). The fatality rate of COVID-19 is currently estimated to be 2 %, which is obviously a lot higher.


	However, the 2009/2010 pandemic had one unusual / scary feature (compared to typical flu epidemics) - it killed young people a lot more. About 80% of fatalities were under 65 years old, while for typical flu only 20% of the fatalities are under 65.


	People with high risk from COVID-19 are described as ""older adults"" (over 60), or with existing chronic medical conditions including heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes. Smokers are also at high risk.

	Well, the news agencies are definitely profiting.


	The markets, as they say, are volatile.  But I think the oil price war between OPEC & Russia has as much to do with that.

	Bit, I believe that the media and social media is driving this story very hard.


	When a new flu strain hits, the medical professionals always push real hard to wash our hands, use hand sanitizer, cover our coughs and sneezes and isolate ourselves if we have a fever or feel sick.


	With our current geopolitical climate and the accessibility of the media/social media, the Covid-19 story is in our faces.


	I just read that WHO has now declared this a pandemic even though they admit that this doesn’t really meet the pandemic criteria used in the past.


	I for one will continue living life as I did 2 months ago before this all broke out. I will continue to use common sense regarding this virus just like I have done with colds, flu, pneumonia, bronchitis, etc.


	I’ll continue to travel on business on an as needed basis domestically.  I’ll evaluate each trip to determine if I can handle this from my desk or do I really need to travel. I will eliminate foreign travel (even to Canada and Mexico) for the next month, maybe longer. Again, just using common sense here. I’ll still go to restaurants, drive Uber, maybe go to sporting events, etc. I will still hobby as before. No changes there.


	Now if the people who contract the coronavirus start mutating and turning into zombies, it will definitely be time to reassess my life style. But hobbying will not stop.

	I’d go a slightly different route. We can focus on the media but the pure lack of information starting from the source, China, and its response to it; locking down billions of people, making people disappear, preventing doctors from speaking on it, and whatever other measures they’ve put in place to ensure 0 info gets out including their infection and mortality rates make it a bit more scary than normal. 
	 


	Now if I go the media route and a bit of conspiracy it’s an election year and there’s generally a “major” virus when elections occur. SARS, Avian Flu, Swine Flu, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and now COVID-19. There maybe no correlation but those have all sprung up during election times. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I tend to not go this particular route because it has the potential to undermine an actual threat and people downplay it more then they probably should. 
	 


	If anything this does force people to be way more aware of just how easy it is spread diseases and how little most do to ensure they’re not passing things to others.

			the percentage is expressed as the fraction deaths over the total cases.  To get apples to apples you would really need to see the number of deaths the flu caused in its first year expressed as a fraction over the same number of current corona virus cases recorded over the same initial time frame...
		

			i think flu death rates in the early 1900s was about 2%.  and i believe the corana virus is currently about 1.4%
		

			so many more flu cases recorded each year makes the percentage smaller even though the actual number of fatalities is so much higher and truthfully more telling...
		

			i'd be willing to bet an hour with your ATF that you will never see 360,000 deaths in a corona virus season...

			That is just it.  This particular strain has NOT been around before.  The general family of corona virus has been identified and known since the 1960's.  Numerous ""colds"" and ""flu"" have in reality been from relatively harmless corona virus strains and were misdiagnosed as cold or flu.  Then mutations occur (frequent and common in viruses!!) resulting in not so harmless strains.  Remember SARS and MERS?  Both were very aggressively attacked to stop their spread.  SARS had a death to case rate of over 10 percent.  MERS was far worse.  Both were corona viruses. This new strain is a very close relative and most nearly resembles SARS when compared to other coronas.  COVID 19 is NOT the fucking common cold no matter what Rush and the boys are trying to tell everyone.  Meanwhile the guy in the White House who has never seen a science paper or national security service assessment that he believes is only concerned about preserving his main re-election point - the economy (which is a totally false narrative to begin with!!).  So he marches out Ben Carson, md and lunatic in charge of a federal department, this morning to basically say don't worry be happy, sure some old farts with underlying conditions will die, but so what.  Plan for cruise ship docking on west coast tomorrow (quarantine, don't quarantine, keep on ship, allow off, etc.) ....... uh, we haven't formulated one yet!!! Once they do I am sure the plan will be ""beautiful and perfect.""  And his scapegoat in chief Pence can scarcely get a statement out of his mouth before some other admin luminary contradicts him.  Situation normal ...... deny, divert, lie, and confuse.  Wave flags and red caps and brag of all the things done for ""us"" that are just falsehoods.  A very, very sad time in which we live.  And yes, the far left are just as bad or worse.  If you all vote for either ................. aw, hell, never mind,  why change now with such sterling results???

	Do you even know what flummery is?  What is your point?  What exactly that I said is in any way in conflict with CDC and WHO information, or is in your opinion, incorrect?  The Spanish Flu is a very interesting historic event but has little to do with COVID-19 and our current challenges - completely different viruses, completely different medical capabilities, and the biggest factor today the open free and common world wide travel and hugely increased modes of an epidemic spreading rapidly.

	Please Read some good helpful info about how it lives and what kills it !


https://www.opednews.com/articles/Tips-for-Avoiding-Coronavi-by-Meryl-Ann-Butler-Corona-Virus-Coronavirus-Covid-19_Johns-Hopkins_Physicians-Response-To-Coronavirus_Soap-200329-113.html


		The virus is not a living organism, but a protein molecule (DNA) covered by a protective layer of lipid (fat), which, when absorbed by the cells of the ocular, nasal or buccal mucosa, changes their genetic code. (mutation) and convert them into aggressor and multiplier cells.
	

		Since the virus is not a living organism but a protein molecule, it is not killed, but decays on its own. The disintegration time depends on the temperature, humidity and type of material where it lies.
	

		The virus is very fragile; the only thing that protects it is a thin outer layer of fat. That is why any soap or detergent is the best remedy, because the foam CUTS the FAT (that is why you have to rub so much: for 20 seconds or more, to make a lot of foam). By dissolving the fat layer, the protein molecule disperses and breaks down on its own.
	

		HEAT melts fat; this is why it is so good to use water above 25 degrees Celsius for washing hands, clothes and everything. In addition, hot water makes more foam and that makes it even more useful.
	

		Alcohol or any mixture with alcohol over 65% DISSOLVES ANY FAT, especially the external lipid layer of the virus.
	

		Any mix with 1 part bleach and 5 parts water directly dissolves the protein, breaks it down from the inside.
	

		Oxygenated water helps long after soap, alcohol and chlorine, because peroxide dissolves the virus protein, but you have to use it pure and it hurts your skin.
	

		NO BACTERICIDE SERVES. The virus is not a living organism like bacteria; they cannot kill what is not alive with anthobiotics, but quickly disintegrate its structure with everything said.
	

		NEVER shake used or unused clothing, sheets or cloth. While it is glued to a porous surface, it is very inert and disintegrates only between 3 hours (fabric and porous), 4 hours (copper, because it is naturally antiseptic; and wood, because it removes all the moisture and does not let it peel off and disintegrates). ), 24 hours (cardboard), 42 hours (metal) and 72 hours (plastic). But if you shake it or use a feather duster, the virus molecules float in the air for up to 3 hours, and can lodge in your nose.
	

		The virus molecules remain very stable in external cold, or artificial as air conditioners in houses and cars. They also need moisture to stay stable, and especially darkness. Therefore, dehumidified, dry, warm and bright environments will degrade it faster.
	

		UV LIGHT on any object that may contain it breaks down the virus protein. For example, to disinfect and reuse a mask is perfect. Be careful, it also breaks down collagen (which is protein) in the skin, eventually causing wrinkles and skin cancer.
	

		The virus CANNOT go through healthy skin.
	

		Vinegar is NOT useful because it does not break down the protective layer of fat.
	

		NO SPIRITS, NOR VODKA, serve. The strongest vodka is 40% alcohol, and you need 65%.
	

		LISTERINE IF IT SERVES! It is 65% alcohol.
	

		The more confined the space, the more concentration of the virus there can be. The more open or naturally ventilated, the less.
	

		This is super said, but you have to wash your hands before and after touching mucosa, food, locks, knobs, switches, remote control, cell phone, watches, computers, desks, TV, etc. And when using the bathroom.
	

		You have to HUMIDIFY HANDS DRY from so much washing them, because the molecules can hide in the micro cracks. The thicker the moisturizer, the better.
	

		Also keep your NAILS SHORT

While disinfectant products on this list have not been tested specifically against SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, they are expected to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 because they have been tested and proven effective on either a harder-to-kill virus or against another human corona-virus similar to SARS-CoV-2.

""It may seem like it would only help the fight against bacteria and germs, but mixing bleach with other cleaners can cause serious problems. The Association of Residential Cleaning Services, International (ARCSI) says bleach should never be mixed with the following:""



Vinegar: When bleach and vinegar are mixed together, the combination creates chlorine gas which can cause eye irritation and breathing problems.
	

Ammonia: Bleach mixed with ammonia creates chloramine, a gas which is similar to chlorine gas. Additional symptoms from exposure to chloramine are shortness of breath and chest pain.
	

Pine-Sol: If you mix bleach and Pine-Sol in large amounts, it will create chlorine gas.

How to Clean Your Groceries in the Age of Coronavirus, According to Food Safety Experts



Start with clean hands and surfaces


""First up: Schaffner recommends washing or sanitizing your hands as soon as you get home from the store. 


Then, you can get to cleaning. In general, it’s just a good idea to be washing your produce thoroughly anyway. “Produce can harbor many harmful bacteria which pose a greater threat to you than coronavirus would in this context,” Dr. Adalja says.


To do so, gently rub your produce while holding it under running water, but soap isn’t necessary or recommended. “There is a toxicity of soap and detergent to consider,” Chapman says. “If there are soap residues on produce and someone has an intolerance to it, that could cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.” Chapman calls the recommendation “silly, without forethought towards food safety, food science, and microbiology.”


If you have a produce brush at home, food safety expert Darin Detwiler, Ph.D., director of the Regulatory Affairs of Food and Food Industries program at Northeastern University, recommends using that to get into any crevices that might be in your produce. “After you clean it, take a paper towel and rub it dry,” he says. “Getting a little friction in there after you clean it is a good idea.” Once you’re done handling your produce, wash your hands again.""

Not according to Chapman.


""It [washing] removes some of the protection that the plant has against mold and yeast to prevent spoilage,"" he says.


Fruits and vegetables contain phytochemicals, harmless bacteria, and oil that prevent mold and yeast from growing, Chapman explains.


Just use water...



Wash all fresh fruits and vegetables with cool tap water immediately before eating. There's no need to use soap or a produce wash.
		

			Gently rub produce while holding under plain running water. For firm produce such as melons and cucumbers, scrub with a clean produce brush.

″‘Mild’ was a positive test, fever, cough ― maybe even pneumonia, but not needing oxygen,” he explained. ”‘Severe’ was breathing rate up and oxygen saturation down, so needing oxygen or a ventilator. ""Critical’ was respiratory failure or multi-organ failure.”

	After about 7 decades of life as a fine, upright, handsome example of American manhood I have grown accustomed to female attention and the occasional approach by attractive younger ladies. That is my story, anyway, and I will stick to it.


	Yesterday, while walking from the store to my car I was approached in the parking lot by a lovely young woman. She wasted no time at all, asking if I might be interested in trading with her, sex for toilet paper.


	I said ""Maybe. What kind of toilet paper do you have?""

	It seems the time for conservatism. Thinking of starting a class entitled ""only one square at a time"".  This would include a lab portion with every class.


	The class size:  one adult (female)

	Whaaaaaaaaaat? Food, alcohol, and the toilet in one room! YOU NEVER HAVE TO EXCUSE YOURSELF! Then you can hop in the shower and suds up instantly turning it into a foam party.

	Democrats in Congress today officially denounced President Trump for FAILING to stop the spread of Corona Virus. On the floor, Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned the President saying, "" The first hour the Virus was discovered in China, Trump should have locked down all U.S borders air tight"".  When asked to respond, President Trump replied, ""  What did Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats expect me to do? Instantly surround the U.S with a wall or something?""

	An experienced, but excited man went to visit a provider. As they got started, she explained that because of CV-19, she was only offering oral services. Interested in something else he assured her that he was healthy but she insisted ...no exceptions. The man sighed but agreed. Much to his surprise, he had the most intense experience of his life. Afterwards, he kissed her goodbye and was leaving. He shook his head, turned and asked, "" I'm no rookie but about halfway through you started in with the most incredible heavenly technique the rest of the way ...what  do you call what you were doing? The provider smiled and replied, "" It's called a CV-19 coughing fit""

	A man walks into the liquor store. A tired looking clerk asks..."" May I help you sir?""  The man replies, "" Yes, I would like a case of Corona.""  The clerk leans forward and coughs violently into the mans face then says. "" There ya go sir, I just ordered it...you should have your case of Corona in 7 to 14 days"".

	I know exactly what you mean. This has required very little adjustment in my life, and my worst hardship so far is that I'm getting bored with home cooking.


	By the way, I bought a dozen ""mega"" rolls of TP the other morning at my local Safeway shopping during the ""senior only"" hour from 7 to 8 am. 12 mega rolls of TP will last me 6 months.
